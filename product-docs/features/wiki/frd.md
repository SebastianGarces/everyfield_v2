## Overview

The Wiki is a comprehensive educational resource providing church planters with structured guidance and best practices throughout their church planting journey. It combines the proven methodology from the Launch Playbook with practical templates, tutorials, and reference materials.

The Wiki is designed to help planters **learn**, understand the **why** behind each phase, and access **actionable resources** when they need them.

### Source of Expertise

The primary knowledge foundation is the **Launch Playbook** methodology (Harvest Bible Fellowship), which provides:

- Core Group development process
- Vision Meeting best practices & critical success factors
- Follow-up procedures & commitment formalization
- Ministry team structure & responsibilities
- Project management approach
- Launch Sunday preparation
- Administrative setup (legal, financial, technology)

Secondary sources include:
- Network coaches' experiential knowledge
- Successful planters' retrospectives and case studies
- Templates and documents from actual church plants
- Video content from training events

[Church phase updated (e.g., Phase 1 → Phase 2)]
    ↓
System identifies new relevant wiki content
    ↓
[Notification]: "You've moved to Phase 2! New content unlocked."
    ↓
Wiki home updates:
├── "Recommended for You" shows Phase 2 articles
├── Phase timeline highlights new phase

## Integration Contracts

This feature integrates with cross-cutting services defined in [System Architecture](../../system-architecture.md).

### Inbound (This Feature Consumes)

| Data | Contract | Source |
|------|----------|--------|
| **Current phase** | Read `church.current_phase` to filter phase-relevant content | Phase Engine |
| **User identity** | Read `user.id` for progress tracking and bookmarks | Auth Service |

### Outbound (This Feature Provides)

| Data | Contract | Consumers |
|------|----------|-----------|
| **Article completion** | Exposes `WikiProgress` by `user_id` for coaching metrics | Dashboard aggregation |
| **Template links** | Exposes `WikiTemplate.id` for document generation context | Document generation flow |
| **Contextual help** | Exposes article lookup by `slug` and `phase` for in-app help | Platform-wide contextual help system |

---

## Contextual Surfacing Rules

The wiki should appear contextually throughout the platform:

| Context | Wiki Content Surfaced |
|---------|----------------------|
| Creating first Vision Meeting | "Your First Vision Meeting" tutorial |
| Vision Meeting detail view | "8 Critical Success Factors" reference |
| Adding first Core Group member | "The 4 C's Explained" |
| Conducting follow-up | "The 5 Interview Criteria" |
| Entering Phase 2 | "When to Set a Launch Date" |
| Ministry Teams dashboard | Team-specific wiki sections |
| Budget setup | "First Year Budget" how-to |
| Facility search | "Site Selection Guide" |

---

## UI/UX Requirements

### General
- Responsive design (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- Clean, readable typography optimized for long-form reading
- Generous whitespace and clear hierarchy
- Consistent navigation patterns

### Reading Experience
- Comfortable line length (60-80 characters)
- Clear heading hierarchy (H1, H2, H3)
- Code-like styling for checklists and structured content
- Callout boxes for tips, warnings, important notes
- Smooth scroll with anchor linking

### Navigation
- Sticky side navigation on desktop
- Collapsible mobile navigation
- Breadcrumb trail always visible
- "On this page" TOC for long articles
- Keyboard shortcuts (j/k for next/prev, / for search)

### Accessibility
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Screen reader compatible
- Keyboard navigation support
- High contrast mode option
- Adjustable font size

### Performance
- Articles load in < 1 second
- Search results in < 500ms
- Lazy load images and videos
- Offline reading support (future enhancement)

---

## Success Metrics

### Engagement Metrics
- Articles read per user per week
- Average time spent reading per session
- Search usage frequency
- Bookmark usage
- Template download count

### Learning Metrics
- Wiki completion percentage by phase
- Correlation between wiki usage and phase progression speed
- Most/least accessed articles
- Drop-off points in long articles

### Content Quality Metrics
- Article helpfulness ratings (thumbs up/down)
- Search queries with no results (content gaps)
- Time to first wiki access (onboarding)
- Return visits to specific articles

---

## Content Development Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (MVP)
- Structure Launch Playbook content into wiki framework
- Phase 0 complete content (6 articles)
- Phase 1 complete content (20 articles)
- Core frameworks content (6 articles)
- Essential templates (Commitment Card, Vision Meeting materials)
- Basic search functionality

### Phase 2: Enhancement
- Phase 2-6 complete content
- Full administrative section
- All templates and checklists
- Video content integration
- Advanced search with filters

### Phase 3: Enrichment
- Case studies from real church plants
- Coach-contributed content
- Interactive assessments and quizzes
- Personalized reading paths

### Phase 4: Community
- Coach annotations and tips
- Network-specific customizations
- User-contributed tips and learnings
- Content versioning and changelog

---

## Oversight Access Patterns

### Coach Access
Coaches can view wiki progress and bookmarks for their assigned churches. This includes per-article completion status, overall phase completion percentages, and bookmark lists. Access is read-only.

### Sending Church Admin Access
Sending church admins can see aggregate wiki completion rates across their plants — specifically, the percentage of articles completed per phase for each church plant they have sent.

### Network Admin Access
Network admins can see aggregate wiki completion rates across all plants in their network, enabling comparison of content engagement across the portfolio.

### Privacy Controls
- Wiki data is **not subject to privacy toggles** since it tracks content consumption, not church-specific operational data
- Wiki progress metrics (articles read, phase completion %) are always visible to oversight roles
- No per-feature privacy toggle is needed for wiki

---

## Open Questions

1. **Content authoring:** Will wiki content be authored directly in the codebase (MDX files) or through an admin CMS interface?

2. **Multi-language support:** Is localization needed for Spanish or other languages?

3. **Coach overlay:** Should coaches be able to add notes/annotations to articles visible only to their planters?

4. **Network customization:** ~~Can networks customize certain articles or add network-specific content?~~ **Resolved:** WikiArticle supports `church_id` scoping (null = global, value = church-specific). Network-level scoping deferred to future enhancement if needed.

5. **Print/Export:** Should users be able to export entire sections as PDF for offline reference?

6. **Versioning:** How do we handle content updates? Show changelog? Notify users of significant changes?

7. **Interactive elements:** Should tutorials include interactive elements (quizzes, progress checks)?

---

## Future Enhancements

### Post-MVP
- AI-powered search with natural language queries
- Personalized content recommendations based on activity
- In-article glossary tooltips for terminology
- Audio versions of key articles
- Spaced repetition for key concepts

### Long-term
- Community Q&A attached to articles
- Coach-to-planter content assignment ("Read this before our call")
- Content analytics dashboard for network administrators
- Integration with external training platforms (LMS)
- Mobile app with offline reading
