## Core Group Development Overview

Growing and developing the Core Group is the very heart of launching. The process follows a funnel approach that moves people from initial contact through to committed Core Group members.

## Vision Meeting

The top of the funnel of the entire launch process is the **Vision Meeting**. It is the main engine in driving the launch process.

### 8 Critical Success Factors for Vision Meetings

1. **Great Attendance**

### Invitation Strategy

**Cardinal Principle:** The Core Group needs to own the responsibility with the Senior Pastor in building the Core Group numerically. Building the Core Group is job number one for every Core Group member.

#### Step-by-Step Approach

1. **Ask, Seek, Knock**
   - Ask the Lord of Harvest to raise up workers
   - Seek them out (friends, acquaintances, strangers)
   - Knock and invite them to consider joining

2. **Invitation Cards** — Print and distribute to Core Group for handouts

3. **Train for Referrals** — Ask friends and acquaintances for leads from their networks

4. **Set Goals** — Challenge members to invite minimum 5 people to every Vision Meeting; goal of bringing at least one person or couple to every meeting

5. **Leverage Social Media** — Facebook, Twitter, plant website (clear and informative)

6. **Mailing List** — Use sparingly and only with prior permission from Coach (upside: reaches many people; downside: may bring unsuitable candidates)

### Elements of a Vision Meeting

- **CONNECT** — Connect with the people
- **INFORM** — History, Distinctives, values, and DNA
- **CAST VISION** — Clear, Compelling, Challenging
- **ANSWER** — Questions
- **CALL FOR ACTION** — Call for Commitment
- **CAPTURE** — Contact Information
- **FOLLOW UP** — Detailed Next Steps

### Typical Agenda (Formal Vision Meeting)

|------|----------|
| 6:00 - 6:30 | Set up room, AV |

## Follow Up

The importance of timely, effective follow up to those who attend a Vision Meeting cannot be overstated. Do this well and the Core Group grows dramatically. Do it poorly and you waste time planning Vision Meetings.

### 4 Reasons Great Follow Up is Vital

#### 1. Answer Questions
Many people have legitimate questions that didn't come up at Q&A or arose afterward. They need answers before making an informed decision. We want an informed Core Group.

#### 2. Re-Casting the Vision
A follow up meeting gives opportunity to re-cast the vision. Many people need to see something a few times before grasping the importance. Great leaders continually cast vision of future days, events, and fruitfulness.

#### 3. Interview for Fit
Not everyone who attends and is interested is a good fit. Best practices include careful interviewing before allowing someone to sign up.

**Interview Considerations:**
- **Maturity** — Are they spiritually and emotionally mature?
- **Gifted** — Do they bring a needed skill set?
- **Chemistry** — Is there good chemistry between you and them?
- **Right Reasons** — Are they coming for the right reasons?
- **Season of Life** — Are they in a stable season of life?

#### 4. Challenge/Call to Core Group
Personally challenge acceptable candidates to join the Core Group. This is vital and must be consistently pursued.

### Database Management

It is critical to have database management software to accurately and effectively follow up with leads.

**Contact Management Software Options:**
- ACT! (http://www.act.com)
- Goldmine (http://goldmineexpert.com/goldmine/)
- Excel Spreadsheet (in capable hands)

---

## Formalize Commitment

Commitment in church planting is vital and extremely important. Having Core Group members sign a commitment card is a powerful way to reinforce and strengthen commitment.

### Three Key Documents

#### 1. Expectations of a Core Group
Before people can wholeheartedly commit, they need to know expectations. This document brings clarity and simplicity and helps manage expectations.

#### 2. Commitment Card
Each Core Group Member signs this to bring clarity and simplicity to the process.

#### 3. Commitments of a Core Group
This document lays out expectations for the Core Group. Either the Senior Pastor or designated leader signs on behalf of the Core Group.

### Core Group Commitments Include

1. Commitment to the Four Pillars and core values
2. Commitment to quality discipleship: authentic disciples who Worship, Walk with, and Work for Christ
3. Commitment to doctrinal statement
4. Commitment to by-laws
5. Commitment to Elder form of church government
6. Commitment to Trademark Sublicense Agreement
7. Commitment to the church name with geographic location
8. Commitment to church planting (5% of annual budget contribution)
9. Commitment to ongoing training seminars and sessions
10. Commitment regarding Senior Pastor transitions (first five years)
11. Commitment to elder partnership in first year
12. Commitment to fellowship with other churches in the network

## Core Group Assignments

As the Core Group grows during the vision stage, each member has three primary assignments:

### Three Primary Assignments

#### 1. GROW THE CORE GROUP
- Every member is on the front line of growing the Core Group
- Each must feel the weight of this responsibility
- Use sphere of influence
- Ask the Lord to direct to those whose hearts God is preparing
- Actively seek and invite others to Vision Meetings
- This is why we seek COMMITTED, COMPELLED, CONTAGIOUS, and COURAGEOUS members

#### 2. PRAY
- Planting a church is a work of God — only He can build the church
- Each member must own responsibility of fervently and faithfully calling out to the Lord
- Corporate times of prayer seeking the Lord for His work

#### 3. GIVE
- Primary funding comes through the Core Group
- Give generously, faithfully, sacrificially, and joyfully
- God will provide the resources necessary

### Additional Responsibilities Assigned by Senior Pastor

#### Handling of Monies
- Handle finances impeccably and above reproach
- Collecting, counting, recording, and depositing require competent oversight from the beginning
- Look for one or two qualified individuals

#### Worship Site Location
- Finding a place to meet is critical and time-consuming
- Assemble a site selection task force soon after Core Group forms
- Good candidates: people connected in community or in local real estate careers

#### Launch Coordinator
- Find a great project coordinator with proven skills
- Needs project management skills plus willingness to work under Senior Pastor's leadership

### Core Group Meetings

As the Core Group coalesces, meet as a group — usually twice a month for first few months before becoming more frequent.

**Important:** Don't peak too early. Understand this is a lengthy process requiring sustained effort.

### Two Primary Leadership Objectives

#### 1. INSPIRE — Cast Vision
- Continually reinforce vision of the church and what God has called you to
- Remind afresh who God is
- Be renewed by His greatness, transcendence, and awesome attributes
- Accomplish through worship, teaching, prayer, and sharing vision

#### 2. INSTILL — Enculturate Team
- Thoroughly enculturate members in values, distinctives, and DNA
- Great power in alignment
- When people catch the vision and resonate with values, great energy, joy, and momentum is produced

### Core Group Meeting Format

**CAST VISION**
- Renew people's vision of the Living God
- Remind them why we are planting the church
- Worship, Devotional, Prayer
- Updates on what God is doing locally, nationally, and internationally

**ENCULTURATE TEAM**
- Teaching on 4 Pillars, Worship/Walk/Work, Ministry Funnel, etc.
- Visit existing churches
- Attend training events

---

## Targeted Launch Date

Setting a targeted launch date is one of the key milestones in the life of a Core Group. Experience shows that assigning a launch date is an art more than a science.

### Best Seasons to Launch

1. **Fall** — As schools open (best)
2. **Spring** — Prior to Easter (second best)

### Variables Driving Launch Date

- Growing critical mass of people in Core Group (30-40 with target of 100)
- Good momentum in Core Group growth
- Growing cohesiveness in the Core Group
- Financial base established and growing
- Worship Leader identified or good possibilities in sight
- Geographic area identified
- Facilities found or good possibilities in sight
- Enough time for good training and preparation

### Transition: Core Group → Launch Team

**When the Launch Date is Set:**

The Core Group transitions to a **Launch Team**. For a Launch Team, the mission of planting the church is the primary focus; growing the Core Group becomes secondary.

Vision Meetings will still be scheduled, but the focus is now on the hard work of training and preparing for the launch.

### Launch Team Meeting Objectives

The meetings become more frequent and very focused on information and training.

| Objective | Format |
|-----------|--------|
| **CAST VISION** | Worship, Devotional, Prayer; Updates on what God is doing |
| **ENCULTURATE TEAM** | Teaching on 4 Pillars, Worship/Walk/Work; Visit existing churches; Training events |
| **TRAIN THE TEAM** | Corporate Training; Ministry Team training; Outside training; Hands-on observation visits |

## Gantt Chart / Timeline

### Launch Coordinator Responsibilities

Good project management is essential to an excellent launch. Managing details is only one part; equally important is coordination of critical pathways and ensuring deadlines are met.

Many Church Plant Senior Pastors lack the gifting or attention to detail for effective project management. Overcome this by:
1. Recognizing the importance of project management
2. Disciplining yourself to pay attention to detail
3. Finding a good to excellent project manager in the Core Group

### Launch Coordinator Key Functions

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **OWN** | Own the launch process under the leadership of the Senior Pastor |
| **LEAD** | Lead the project building a cohesive and coordinated leader team |
| **DEVELOP** | Develop project timeline, milestones and critical pathways |
| **MANAGE** | Manage the timeline, informing leaders of deadlines and keeping on schedule |
| **SCHEDULE** | Schedule and chair project meetings to keep key leaders informed and working together |
| **BRING** | Bring the church launch in on schedule and on budget |

### Recommendation

Use the Launch Project Schedule document as a starting point. Work with your Launch Coordinator to adjust or add items to tailor to your needs.

**Highly recommended:** Develop a Gantt Chart showing project timelines and critical pathways.

---

## Preparation for Launch Sunday

With Launch Sunday **3-4 weeks out**, preparation intensifies and focuses on a flawless launch. Specific ministry training should be 90%-100% completed.

This 3-4 week window is the time to integrate parts into the whole and work out weaknesses in the system.

### Three Primary Priorities

#### 1. Operations / Set-up & Tear-down

All set-up equipment needed to launch must arrive in this window.

**In-Service Training (Full Saturday):**
- Correct way to set-up and tear-down
- Hands-on experience setting up and tearing down
- Proper storage of equipment
- Proper testing and care of equipment
- Ways to work well as teams during set up and tear down
- Testing and improving acoustics and lighting in Worship Center
- Review of additional operational items

If possible, secure the Worship Center for set up, tear down, and Launch Team meetings. Optimally utilize it **three times** prior to Launch Sunday.

#### 2. Launch Team Preparation

During the final month, intentionally ramp up focus on **prayer**:
- Schedule one day a week for fasting during the 4 weeks prior
- Fasts can end with corporate worship and prayer followed by a shared meal
- Senior Pastor needs to lead this process

**Three Pre-Launch Services** (Book Worship Center for three Sunday nights prior to Launch):

For Launch Team only, these accomplish:
- Set-up/Tear-down — working as a team
- Worship Team — opportunity to bring worship together
- Preaching/Teaching — Peak Performance I, II, III (membership classes)
- Children's Ministry roll out — teachers, curriculum, check in, safety
- Assimilation testing
- Prayer, Thanksgiving and Celebration

Schedule on Saturday or Sunday night. These are invaluable to a successful launch.

#### 3. Promotion Plan Implemented

Three to four weeks out triggers full launch of the promotion plan. Get the word out to as many people as possible using every means available.

**Promotion Elements (based on financial condition):**
- Radio announcements
- Local email blast
- Press release to local media outlets
- Advertising on radio and cable stations
- Social Media: Facebook, Twitter
- Video brochures (DVDs)
- Invitation cards
- Billboard advertising
- Portable outdoor signs
- Door hangers
- Direct mail postcards
- Personal invitation goals for Launch Team
- Promotion within partner churches
- Social media, web
- Inserts to local newspapers

Not every item will be utilized. Develop a well-thought-out plan prayerfully. While confidence is in the Lord building the church, spend yourselves in preparation and getting the word out.

---

## Launch Sunday

As the historic day arrives, several details need attention.

### 5 Priority Details

#### 1. Checklists Prepared and Implemented

Every key ministry leader should develop Sunday morning checklists with their team. While prepared for Launch Sunday, implement them every week.

**Develop checklists for:**
- Set up/Tear Down Team
- Signage and Parking
- Facility
- Greeters/Ushers
- Children's Ministry
- Worship Team
- Assimilation

Checklists ensure attention to detail and consistency in execution. **They are not optional.**

#### 2. Video and Photography Capture

Launch Sunday is a day of celebration and remembrance. Give good thought to capturing the day so it can be remembered frequently and God glorified. Many great launches have failed to adequately record this important day to their regret.

#### 3. Announcement in All Partner Churches

The week prior to launch, a PowerPoint slide of the Senior Pastor and family along with the launch announcement goes to every partner church. This powerful tie connects all churches and reminds us of God's great plans and mercy. Ensure this task is accomplished with a quick email.

#### 4. Partner Organization Role in the Service Identified

Coordinate with partners about their role in the service:
- If a senior team member attends, introduce them to greet the congregation
- If no one attends, a video greeting can be sent

#### 5. After Service Celebration

Launch Sunday is a day of massive celebration recognizing God's goodness and mercy. Don't overlook some type of after-service celebration with the Launch Team.

It need not be expensive or elaborate — something meaningful and thoughtful.

---

## Administrative

This section covers essential administrative responsibilities necessary for launching the church.

### Legal

#### Setting Up a Not-for-Profit Corporation
Most states follow a similar process with slight variations. Follow your state's requirements.

#### Setting Up a Tax Exempt Organization (501(c)(3))
Steps are necessary to set up a tax-exempt organization.

**Online Filing Services to Consider:**

#### Collections — Principles of Financial Accountability

**Core Principles:**
- Accomplish all necessary activities with reasonable cost
- Maintain a financial environment meeting all biblical financial principles
- Establish financial processes that can grow with the church
- Senior Pastor should **not** handle any money or write any checks (great protection to avoid anything questionable)

**Establish a Financial Leader immediately** who:
- Welcomes others reviewing work as protection of integrity
- Separates collection/counting from disbursement functions

**Physical Handling of Cash & Checks:**
- Handle securely and confidentially
