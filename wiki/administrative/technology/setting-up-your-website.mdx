Your website is often the first impression someone has of your church. Before they ever walk through your doors, they'll search for you online. A clear, welcoming, informative website can be the difference between a guest visiting or continuing their search.

This guide walks you through establishing an effective web presence for your church plant.

## Why Your Website Matters

In today's world, a website is essential—not optional. Here's what it accomplishes:

**Credibility** — A professional website signals that your church is legitimate and prepared.

**Information hub** — Service times, location, beliefs, and leadership all in one place.

**First impression** — For many guests, the website is their first encounter with your church.

**Discoverability** — People search online for churches in their area.

**Connection point** — Ways to contact, ask questions, and get involved.

  Get your website up early in the process—even before launch. People researching churches need to find you, and your Core Group needs something to share.

## Essential Website Features

Your church website doesn't need to be complex, but it does need to cover the basics well.

### Must-Have Pages

| Page | Content |
|------|---------|
| Home | Welcoming message, service times, location basics |
| About | Who you are, your story, beliefs, values |
| Visit | What to expect, directions, parking, children's ministry info |
| Contact | Ways to reach you, basic contact form |
| Leadership | Pastor bio and photo, key leaders |

### Essential Information (Above the Fold)

When someone lands on your homepage, they should immediately see:

- Church name and logo
- Service times
- Location (or "launching soon" if pre-launch)
- Clear call to action (visit, learn more, contact)

### Nice-to-Have Features

These can wait until after launch if budget or time is limited:

- Online giving
- Event calendar
- Blog
- Staff directory

## Choosing a Website Provider

Several factors should guide your provider selection.

### Provider Selection Criteria

**Understands your ministry approach** — Church-specific providers know what churches need.

**Good solution at good price** — Balance cost with capability.

**Available for training** — You need to update content without calling support every time.

### Provider Options

**Church-specific platforms** — Designed for churches with built-in features like sermon hosting, event management, and giving integration. Examples: Subsplash, Church Online Platform, Faithlife Sites.

**General website builders** — Flexible platforms that work for any organization. More design freedom but may require more setup. Examples: Squarespace, Wix, WordPress.

**Custom development** — Maximum flexibility but highest cost and complexity. Usually not necessary for church plants.

<Callout type="tip">
  For most church plants, a church-specific platform offers the best balance of ease, features, and value. The church-specific features save significant time.

### Questions to Ask Providers

- What's included in the monthly/annual cost?
- How easy is it to update content?
- Is the site mobile-responsive?
- What integrations are available (giving, events, ChMS)?
- What support is included?
- Can I see examples of churches like mine using your platform?

## Domain Name

Your domain is your address on the web. Choose it carefully.

### Domain Best Practices

**Use your church name** — If "GraceChurch.com" isn't available, try variations like "GraceChurchCityName.com" or "GraceCityName.church".

**Keep it simple** — Easy to say, spell, and remember.

**Avoid hyphens and numbers** — Hard to communicate verbally.

**Consider the .church extension** — Immediately identifies you as a church.

### Securing Your Domain

- Register your domain early
- Set up auto-renewal to avoid losing it
- Keep registration information updated
- Consider registering common misspellings

### Writing for the Web

- Write short paragraphs (2-3 sentences)

- Include clear calls to action

### Photography

Quality photography dramatically improves your site:

- Use photos of actual people from your church (with permission)
- Avoid generic stock photos when possible
- Ensure images are high quality and properly sized
- Include diversity that reflects your community

### Voice and Tone

Your website should sound like your church:

- Warm and welcoming
