The moment someone places an offering in the plate, a sacred trust begins. That gift represents sacrifice, obedience, and faith. How your church handles those offerings—from the moment they're collected until they're deposited—either honors or diminishes that trust.

This guide establishes procedures for secure, accountable handling of cash and check offerings.

## Guiding Principles

Three principles guide all collection procedures:

**Security** — Offerings must be protected from loss, theft, or mishandling at every step.

**Confidentiality** — Individual giving information must be protected from inappropriate access.

**Accountability** — Multiple people should be involved at each stage, with clear documentation.

<Callout type="important">
  No single individual should handle offerings alone at any time. This protects both the church's resources and the individuals involved.
</Callout>

## During the Service

### Ushers and Collection Teams

Train ushers in proper procedures before their first service:

- Use offering plates, bags, or boxes that are secure and appropriate for your context
- Have a predetermined collection pattern that covers all seating areas
- Know where to take offerings after collection
- Never leave collected offerings unattended

### Immediate Transfer

After collection, offerings should be:

1. Transferred immediately to a secure, locked container
2. Taken directly to a secure location by at least two people
3. Kept out of public areas and traffic patterns

---

## Physical Security

### Secure Containers

- Use containers that can be locked (lock boxes, safes, or lockable bank bags)
- Keep keys carefully controlled by designated individuals only
- Never leave containers unlocked, even briefly

### Transportation

When moving offerings from worship space to counting room or bank:

- Always use at least two people
- Use locked containers or bank bags
- Take direct routes without unnecessary stops
- Never leave offerings in vehicles unattended

### P.O. Box Procedures

If your church receives offerings by mail:

- Retrieve mail with at least two people when possible
- Place checks immediately into a locked container before the service
- Don't open envelopes or handle contents until official counting time

---

## Handling Guidelines

### Cash

Cash requires the highest level of care:

| Do | Don't |
|-----|-------|
| Keep in locked container | Leave in open areas |
| Count with multiple people | Let one person handle alone |
| Deposit as quickly as possible | Hold for extended periods |
| Document amounts immediately | Wait to record |

### Checks

Checks are slightly more secure but still require careful handling:

- Endorse checks "For Deposit Only" as soon as possible
- Record check numbers and amounts
- Keep checks separate from cash for counting purposes
- Store securely until deposit

### Envelopes

Many churches use giving envelopes:

- Don't open envelopes until official counting time
- Keep sealed envelopes in secure storage
- Record envelope numbers for donor tracking

<Callout type="tip">
  Pre-printed envelopes with donor numbers help ensure accurate record-keeping while maintaining confidentiality during collection.

## After the Service

### Immediate Steps

1. Move offerings to a secure counting location
2. Document transfer with signatures (who received from whom)
3. Do not leave offerings unattended between service and counting
4. If counting is delayed, secure in a safe or lockbox with documented custody

### When Counting is Delayed

Sometimes counting can't happen immediately after the service. In these cases:

- Place offerings in a locked safe or secure container
- Document who placed them there and when
- Document who retrieved them for counting
- Never allow single-person access

---

## Special Situations

### Large Cash Gifts

When someone gives a large cash gift:

- Count immediately with two people present
- Provide a written receipt to the donor
- Document thoroughly in counting records
- Consider bank deposit that day for security

### Designated Gifts

Gifts designated for specific purposes require:

- Clear documentation of the designation
- Proper coding in your accounting system
- Communication to the donor if designation cannot be honored
- See the [Designated Giving Policies](/wiki/administrative/financial/designated-giving-policies) article for more detail

### Anonymous Gifts

When gifts arrive without donor identification:

- Record as anonymous in your system
- Count and deposit normally
- Note any accompanying instructions
- Keep any notes or letters for reference

---

## Record Keeping

### At Time of Collection

Document:
- Date and service
- Who collected (ushers on duty)
- Who received offerings after collection
- Where offerings were secured

### Chain of Custody

Maintain a clear record of who had custody of offerings at every point:

1. Ushers during collection
2. Team members during transfer to secure location
3. Counting team during counting
4. Team members taking deposit to bank

---

## Training Requirements

Everyone involved in handling offerings should understand:

- Why procedures matter (protection for them and the church)
- Their specific responsibilities
- What to do if something seems wrong
- Who to contact with questions

### Regular Reminders

Even trained volunteers benefit from periodic reminders:

- Review procedures quarterly
- Address any observed shortcuts or variations
- Thank team members for their faithfulness

<Callout type="insight">
  The best protection against problems is a culture where everyone understands why procedures matter and feels responsible for maintaining them.
</Callout>

## Integration with Counting

Collection procedures flow directly into counting procedures. Ensure:

- Smooth handoff between collection and counting teams
- Clear documentation of what was transferred
- Consistent procedures from week to week

See [Counting Procedures](/wiki/administrative/financial/counting-procedures) for what happens after collection.
