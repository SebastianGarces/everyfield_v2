Collecting money is only half the financial picture. How you spend money—the approval process, the controls, the documentation—is equally important. This guide establishes the disbursement procedures that protect your church and ensure every expenditure is authorized and appropriate.

---

## Disbursement Principles

### Authorization Before Spending

No money should leave church accounts without proper authorization. The level of authorization depends on the amount and nature of the expense.

### Separation of Duties

The person who requests spending should not be the same person who approves it. And neither should be the only person who can process payment.

### Documentation Trail

Every disbursement needs documentation:
- What was purchased and why
- Who authorized the expense
- Evidence the goods/services were received
- Receipt or invoice

### Budget Alignment

Expenditures should align with the approved budget. Spending outside the budget requires additional approval.

<Callout type="important">
  Never sign blank checks or requisition forms in advance. This creates opportunity for unauthorized spending.
</Callout>

## Approval Thresholds

Establish clear thresholds that determine who can authorize spending:

### Sample Threshold Structure

| Amount | Authorization Required |
|--------|----------------------|
| Under $100 | Single authorized signer |
| $100 - $500 | Department leader approval |
| $500 - $2,500 | Senior Pastor approval |
| $2,500 - $10,000 | Senior Pastor + Finance Leader |
| Over $10,000 | Elder board approval |

Adjust these thresholds based on your church size and budget. A small church plant may have lower thresholds than an established congregation.

### Minimum Transaction Limit

**Over the minimum transaction limit** (agreed upon by elders):
- Minimum two signatures required from accountable church members appointed by elders/deacons

**Below minimum transaction limit:**
- One authorized signature allowed

### Maximum Transaction Limit

**Above the maximum transaction limit:**
- Must have elder board approval before spending
- No exceptions regardless of urgency
- Document the approval in board minutes

## Disbursement Methods

### Manual Checks

For payments made by physical check:

| Amount | Requirement |
|--------|-------------|
| Over threshold | Two signatures on the check |
| Under threshold | One signature acceptable |

**Check handling:**
- Checks kept in secure location
- Access limited to authorized signers
- Check register maintained accurately
- Voided checks retained and marked

### Online Bill Payments

For payments made through online banking:

- Two signatures required on requisition form or approved invoice
- One person initiates payment in system
- Second person reviews and approves
- Documentation attached in accounting system

### Debit Card Purchases

If your church uses debit cards:

- Two signatures required on requisition form
- Pre-approval required before purchase
- Receipts submitted within 48 hours
- Reconciled against bank statement monthly

<Callout type="warning">
  Debit cards create risk because they directly access church funds. Consider using credit cards with low limits instead, paying the balance monthly.
</Callout>

### Credit Card Purchases

Credit cards can provide better protection:

- Set low credit limits
- Require pre-approval for purchases
- Receipts required for all transactions
- Statements reviewed and reconciled monthly
- Pay balance in full each month

### Reimbursements

For people who use personal funds for church expenses:

1. Pre-approval required for reimbursement eligibility
2. Original receipts required
3. Reimbursement request form completed
4. Approved by appropriate level
5. Processed within standard payment cycle

## Payment Processing Workflow

### Standard Process

```
Request → Approval → Processing → Payment → Documentation
```

**Step 1: Request**
- Requestor completes purchase requisition
- Includes description, amount, budget line, purpose
- Attaches any quotes or documentation

**Step 2: Approval**
- Appropriate authority reviews and approves
- Verifies budget availability
- Signs or electronically approves

**Step 3: Processing**
- Finance team prepares payment
- Verifies approval is on file
- Matches to invoice or receipt

**Step 4: Payment**
- Check written or electronic payment initiated
- Required signatures obtained
- Payment sent to vendor

**Step 5: Documentation**
- File all supporting documents together
- Enter in accounting system
- Update budget tracking

### Emergency Process

For urgent, unplanned needs:

1. Verbal authorization from Senior Pastor
2. Document authorization in writing within 24 hours
3. Follow normal documentation procedures
4. Report emergency spending to Finance Leader
5. Review in next leadership meeting

---

## Requisition Form Elements

A standard purchase requisition should include:

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Date requested | Timeline tracking |
| Requestor name | Accountability |
| Vendor/Payee | Who receives payment |
| Amount | Expected cost |
| Budget line item | Where funds come from |
| Description/Purpose | What and why |
| Quote/Estimate attached | Documentation |
| Requestor signature | Confirms accuracy |
| Approver signature | Authorization |
| Date approved | Timeline tracking |

---

## Invoice Processing

### When Invoices Arrive

1. Date stamp immediately
2. Route to appropriate department for verification
3. Confirm goods/services received as invoiced
4. Match to purchase order or requisition
5. Approve for payment
6. Process within payment terms

### Verification Requirements

Before paying any invoice, verify:

- [ ] Invoice is from legitimate vendor
- [ ] Goods/services were actually received
- [ ] Amount matches agreed price
- [ ] No duplicate invoice exists
- [ ] Appropriate approval obtained
- [ ] Budget available

<Callout type="tip">
  Never pay from statements alone. Always require actual invoices with detail of what was purchased.
</Callout>

---

## Recurring Payments

Some expenses recur monthly or annually:

### Pre-Authorized Recurring

For stable, predictable amounts:
- Authorize annually as part of budget approval
- Review periodically for accuracy
- Include in monthly reconciliation

### Variable Recurring

For amounts that change:
- Require approval for each instance
- Or set authorized range with approval for overages
- Review quarterly at minimum

### Automatic Payments

For bills set up for automatic deduction:
- Ensure proper initial authorization
- Review statements monthly
- Verify amounts match expectations
- Document in accounting system

---

## Audit Trail Requirements

### What to Keep

For every disbursement, retain:

- Purchase requisition or request
- Approval documentation
- Invoice or receipt
- Check copy or payment confirmation
- Any related correspondence
- Record in accounting system

### How Long to Keep

| Document Type | Retention Period |
|---------------|------------------|
| Paid invoices | 7 years |
| Check copies | 7 years |
| Requisition forms | 7 years |
| Bank statements | 7 years |
| Contracts | Duration + 7 years |

### Organization

- File chronologically by payment date
- Or by vendor alphabetically
- Cross-reference in accounting system
- Ensure easy retrieval for audits

---

## Common Problems to Avoid

### Rubber-Stamping Approvals

Approvers should actually review requests:
- Verify the expense makes sense
- Confirm budget availability
- Question unusual items
- Don't sign without reading

### Bypassing the Process

Emergency exceptions become habits:
- Enforce the process consistently
- Address chronic bypassing
- Adjust thresholds if too restrictive
- Don't let convenience override controls

### Inadequate Documentation

Missing receipts create problems:
- Require receipts immediately
- Follow up on missing documentation
- Don't pay without proper support
- Address repeat offenders
