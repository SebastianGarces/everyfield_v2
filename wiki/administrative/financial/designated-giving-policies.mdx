Donors sometimes want their gifts to support specific purposes—missions, building funds, benevolence, or special projects. While designated giving can be a blessing, it also creates complexity. Clear policies protect the church legally, honor donor intent, and ensure flexibility to meet actual needs.

---

## Why Designated Giving Policies Matter

### Legal Compliance

When donors designate gifts for specific purposes, the church has a legal obligation to use those funds as designated. Misusing designated funds can result in loss of tax-exempt status and legal liability.

### Donor Trust

Donors who designate gifts trust that their intentions will be honored. Violating that trust damages relationships and undermines future giving.

### Operational Flexibility

Too many designations can tie up funds the church needs for general operations. Policies help balance donor wishes with organizational needs.

### Administrative Burden

Tracking multiple designated funds requires additional accounting work. Policies should keep this manageable.

<Callout type="important">
  The church is not a "conduit" for unapproved special projects. Gifts can only be designated for specific funds established by the elders.
</Callout>

## Core Policy Principles

### Principle 1: Elder-Established Funds Only

Giving can only be designated for specific funds that the elders have formally established. This means:

- Elders decide what designation options exist
- Donors choose from established options (or give to general fund)
- Requests for new designations go to elder review
- The church doesn't accept arbitrary donor-directed giving

### Principle 2: General Fund Priority

All giving not specifically designated is used for general support and ministry advancement. This provides:

- Flexibility to meet operational needs
- Funds for unexpected opportunities
- Support for budget priorities
- Stability in lean times

### Principle 3: Donor Intent Honored

When donors designate to established funds:

- Gifts are tracked separately
- Funds are used for stated purposes
- Excess funds are handled per fund guidelines
- Donors can trust their intent is respected

## Establishing Designated Funds

### When to Create a Designated Fund

Consider creating a designated fund when:

- There's a significant, specific purpose (building project, missions)
- Multiple donors want to support this purpose
- The purpose aligns with church mission and values
- Administrative capacity exists to track the fund
- Clear criteria exist for using and closing the fund

### Fund Documentation

Each designated fund should have written documentation including:

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Fund name** | Clear, descriptive title |
| **Purpose** | Specific intended use of funds |
| **Duration** | Ongoing or time-limited |
| **Minimum/target** | Financial goals if applicable |
| **Restrictions** | What funds can and cannot be used for |
| **Oversight** | Who manages the fund |
| **Excess handling** | What happens if more is given than needed |
| **Sunset provision** | What happens if the fund is discontinued |

### Common Designated Funds

| Fund Type | Typical Purpose |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Missions** | Support for missionaries and mission organizations |
| **Benevolence** | Assistance for those in financial need |
| **Building** | Facility purchase, construction, or renovation |
| **Scholarships** | Support for students or training |
| **Equipment** | Major equipment purchases |
| **Special projects** | Time-limited specific initiatives |

## Accepting Designated Gifts

### Communication to Donors

Make clear to donors:

- What designation options exist
- How designated funds will be used
- What happens to excess funds
- That undesignated giving supports general operations

### On Giving Envelopes/Forms

List only established designated fund options. Avoid open-ended "Other" boxes that invite arbitrary designations.

### When Donors Request New Designations

If a donor wants to give to something not currently a designated fund:

1. Thank them for their generosity
2. Explain current designated fund options
3. Offer to bring their request to elder review
4. If elders approve, establish the fund properly
5. If elders decline, explain the decision respectfully

<Callout type="tip">
  Most donors are satisfied when they understand the church has a thoughtful system for designated giving. Clear communication prevents most conflicts.

## Accounting for Designated Funds

### Separate Tracking

Each designated fund should be tracked separately in your accounting system:

- Separate account or fund code
- Income tracked by fund
- Expenses tracked by fund
- Balance readily available

### Restricted vs. Unrestricted

In nonprofit accounting terms:

| Classification | Meaning |
|----------------|---------|
| **Unrestricted** | General fund, usable for any purpose |
| **Temporarily restricted** | Designated for specific purpose or time |
| **Permanently restricted** | Principal cannot be spent (endowments) |

Most church designated funds are temporarily restricted—the restriction ends when the funds are used for their intended purpose.

### Reporting

Designated fund reporting should include:

- Beginning balance
- Contributions received
- Expenditures made
- Ending balance
- Progress toward goals (if applicable)

---

## Handling Excess Funds

### When More is Given Than Needed

If a designated fund collects more than needed for its purpose:

**Option 1: Hold for Future Need**
If the purpose is ongoing, retain funds for future expenses.

**Option 2: Transfer to General Fund**
If excess handling is specified in fund documentation and communicated to donors.

**Option 3: Ask Donors**
Contact major donors about redirecting their excess gifts.

**Option 4: Apply to Related Purpose**
Use for a closely related purpose within the spirit of the original designation.

### Documentation Requirement

The fund documentation should specify excess handling before the situation arises. This protects the church and sets clear donor expectations.

<Callout type="warning">
  Never transfer designated funds to general operations without clear policy basis. This can create legal problems and donor distrust.
</Callout>

## Closing a Designated Fund

### When to Close

A designated fund may close when:

- The purpose is fulfilled (building completed)
- The purpose is no longer viable
- The fund has been inactive for extended time
- Elders determine it no longer serves church mission

### Closing Process

1. Review fund documentation for sunset provisions
2. Notify donors of pending closure (if significant amounts involved)
3. Apply remaining funds per documentation
4. Document the closure in financial records
5. Remove from active designation options

---

## Special Situations

### Gifts with Excessive Restrictions

Sometimes donors want restrictions beyond what's appropriate:

- "Only for the Smith family's benevolence needs"
- "Only if Pastor Jones remains the preacher"
- "Must be invested in specific stocks"

**Response:** Explain that the church can't accept gifts with restrictions that compromise operational flexibility or create administrative burden. Offer alternatives that might meet their goals within acceptable parameters.

### Memorial Gifts

When gifts are given in memory of someone:

- Acknowledge the gift and the person memorialized
- Apply to general fund unless a designated fund is specified
- Consider a general "Memorial Fund" for these gifts
- Use memorial funds for lasting purposes (equipment, improvements)

### Gifts from Estates

Bequests and estate gifts may come with restrictions:

- Review will or trust language carefully
- Consult with attorney if restrictions are unclear
- Honor restrictions that are specific and reasonable
- Work with estate executor for clarification if needed

---

## Policy Communication

### In New Member Materials

Include designated giving policy overview so new members understand:

- How to designate gifts
- What options exist
- How undesignated gifts are used

### Annual Reminders

Periodically remind the congregation:

- The importance of general fund giving
- What designated fund options exist
- Progress on designated fund goals

### On Giving Platforms

Online and text giving should clearly present:

- General fund as the default
- Established designated fund options
- No open-ended designation field

Clear designated giving policies honor both the generosity of donors and the stewardship responsibilities of church leadership. Set good policies early and communicate them clearly.
