Counting the offering is where careful handling meets accurate record-keeping. Proper counting procedures ensure every gift is recorded correctly, every donor receives credit, and every dollar reaches its intended purpose. This guide establishes the standards that protect your church and honor your donors.

## Counting Principles

### Accuracy

Every dollar counted must match what's deposited. Every check must be attributed correctly. Accuracy isn't optional—it's essential for donor trust and financial integrity.

### Accountability

Multiple people present during counting prevents errors and protects everyone involved. No one should count alone, regardless of how trusted they are.

### Confidentiality

Counting team members see individual giving amounts. This information must remain confidential. Team members should never discuss who gave what or how much.

### Documentation

Create a clear paper trail from offering container to bank deposit. Documentation enables verification and protects against discrepancies.

<Callout type="important">
  Counting should always involve a minimum of three people. This provides accountability and enables verification of totals.
</Callout>

## Counting Team Organization

### Team Composition

**Recommended approach: Rotating teams of at least 3 people**

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|------------------|
| **Lead Counter** | Coordinates process, resolves questions, verifies totals |
| **Counters** | Count cash, tally checks, prepare deposit |
| **Recorder** | Documents amounts, enters data, creates deposit slip |

### Team Selection

Staff teams with church members known for:

- Discretion and godly behavior
- Attention to detail
- Availability on a consistent schedule
- Ability to maintain confidentiality

### Rotation Schedule

**Rotate both the team schedule and team members:**
- No team should count every week
- Mix team compositions periodically
- Prevents patterns that could enable manipulation
- Provides backup when someone is absent

## Counting Environment

### Location Requirements

Counting should take place in:

- A quiet room away from traffic and interruptions
- A space that can be secured during counting
- An area with adequate table space and lighting
- A location with access to counting supplies

### Security During Counting

- Lock the door during counting
- Don't allow interruptions except emergencies
- Keep offering materials out of sight of windows
- Maintain security until deposit is prepared

## Step-by-Step Counting Process

### Step 1: Preparation

Before beginning:

- [ ] Gather counting sheets, calculator, pens
- [ ] Prepare deposit slip
- [ ] Ensure all team members are present
- [ ] Secure the counting room

### Step 2: Open and Sort

1. Open locked container together
2. Empty all offering containers
3. Initial sort: Separate cash, checks, envelopes
4. Set aside designated gifts for separate handling

### Step 3: Count Cash

**First count:**
- One person counts all currency
- Sort by denomination
- Count each denomination separately
- Record total on counting sheet

**Verification count:**
- Second person recounts all currency
- Must match first count exactly
- If discrepancy, both recount until amounts match
- Record verified amount

### Step 4: Process Checks

For each check:

1. Verify check is properly signed
2. Confirm amount written matches numerical amount
3. Record check on deposit list (name, amount)
4. Endorse check "For Deposit Only" with church account info
5. Note any designation indicated

**Total checks:**
- Add all check amounts
- Second person verifies addition
- Record verified check total

### Step 5: Process Envelopes

If your church uses giving envelopes:

1. Open each envelope
2. Compare envelope information to contents
3. Record donor name and amount
4. Process cash/checks as above
5. Note any designations

<Callout type="tip">
  Retain envelopes with donor information for data entry. This ensures accurate recording of who gave what.
</Callout>

### Step 6: Reconcile

Combine totals:

```
Cash total:        $________
Check total:       $________
                   ---------
Gross total:       $________
Less designated:   $________
                   ---------
General fund:      $________
```

### Step 7: Prepare Deposit

1. Complete deposit slip with date, amounts
2. Place cash and checks in deposit bag
3. Seal bag with deposit slip copy inside
4. Record deposit slip number on counting sheet
5. All counters sign counting sheet

### Step 8: Secure Until Deposit

- Deposit bag stored in safe or secure location
- Note who has responsibility for deposit
- Deposit should occur as quickly as possible

## Counting Sheet Template

Use a standardized counting sheet that includes:

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Date | Identifies service date |
| Service time | If multiple services |
| Currency breakdown | Amount by denomination |
| Coin breakdown | Amount by denomination |
| Cash subtotal | Total currency and coin |
| Check count | Number of checks |
| Check total | Sum of all checks |
| Gross total | Cash + checks |
| Designated amounts | Breakdown by designation |
| General fund total | Non-designated amount |
| Deposit slip number | Links to bank record |
| Counter signatures | Accountability documentation |
| Notes | Any irregularities or comments |

## Using a Bank or Contracted Service

Some churches use banks or third-party services for counting. This can be appropriate when:

- Church has grown beyond volunteer capacity
- Professional accuracy is needed
- Volunteer availability is limited

### Process with External Counting

1. **Immediate separation:** After service, separate cash from checks with at least two ushers present
2. **Count cash:** Count cash on-site with two people; create deposit slip with date, signatures, amount
3. **Secure checks:** Keep checks in sealed, secure container
4. **Contractor pickup:** Contractor comes to church during staffed hours
5. **Processing:** Contractor scans checks, enters data, prepares deposit
6. **Deposit cash:** Deposit cash as quickly as possible, separate from checks

<Callout type="warning">
  Even with external services, maintain church oversight. Review reports promptly and verify deposits against bank statements.
</Callout>

## Handling Discrepancies

### Cash Doesn't Match Recount

1. Stop and recount together
2. Organize by denomination and recount each
3. Check for stuck bills or missed stacks
4. If still off, document discrepancy and proceed
5. Report discrepancy to Financial Leader

### Check Amount Unclear

1. If written and numerical amounts differ, use written amount
2. Contact donor if amount is significantly unclear
3. Document the issue on counting sheet
4. Don't guess—clarify before depositing

### Missing Information

1. Note incomplete information on counting sheet
2. Process what you can
3. Follow up with donor for missing details
4. Don't delay deposit for minor missing info
