Your first year budget is more than a financial document—it's a roadmap for launching your church. A well-constructed budget forces you to think through priorities, anticipate needs, and establish financial disciplines that will serve your church for years to come.

This guide walks you through creating a realistic, comprehensive first year budget that honors God's resources and positions your church for healthy growth.

## Why Budget Planning Matters

A thoughtful budget accomplishes several critical objectives:

**Clarity** — Forces you to define priorities and make difficult trade-offs before you're under pressure.

**Communication** — Helps your Core Group understand what's needed and builds ownership of financial goals.

**Accountability** — Provides a benchmark for measuring actual performance against expectations.

**Stewardship** — Demonstrates responsible management of the resources God provides.

## Budget Development Process

### Step 1: Understand Your Context

Before creating numbers, understand your situation:

- What is your anticipated launch date?
- How large is your Core Group?
- What facilities costs do you anticipate?
- What equipment do you already have vs. need to purchase?
- What financial commitments has your Core Group made?

### Step 2: Gather Resources

Use budget worksheets and sample first-year budgets from other church plants to inform your planning. Your coach can provide templates and examples that reflect realistic expectations.

### Step 3: Draft Your Budget

Create initial estimates for all expense categories (detailed below).

### Step 4: Review with Your Coach

Walk through your draft with your coach. They'll identify unrealistic assumptions, missing items, and opportunities to optimize.

### Step 5: Finalize and Communicate

Once approved, communicate the budget to your Core Group. Transparency builds trust and ownership.

## Income Projections

Projecting income for a new church requires balancing faith with realism. Most first-year income comes from three sources:

### Core Group Giving

This is typically your primary income source in year one. Estimate conservatively based on:

- Number of committed Core Group households
- Known giving commitments
- Historical giving patterns (if members come from other churches)

<Callout type="tip">
  Don't assume everyone will give equally or consistently. Build in some margin for life changes, job losses, and giving that doesn't materialize as expected.
</Callout>

### Outside Support

This may include:

- Denominational or network support
- Partner church contributions
- Grants from foundations
- Personal support raised by the Senior Pastor

Document these commitments carefully and note any conditions or time limits.

### Launch Sunday and Beyond

After launch, you'll begin receiving offerings from guests and new attenders. Be conservative in these projections—it takes time to build a giving culture with new people.

## Expense Categories

A comprehensive first-year budget addresses these major categories:

### Personnel

| Item | Considerations |
|------|---------------|
| Senior Pastor salary | May include housing allowance for tax benefits |
| Staff salaries | Any additional staff in year one |
| Payroll taxes | Employer portion of FICA, unemployment insurance |
| Benefits | Health insurance, retirement contributions |

Personnel typically represents 40-60% of a church budget. For a church plant, this percentage may be higher initially.

### Facilities

| Item | Considerations |
|------|---------------|
| Rent for worship space | Usually the largest non-personnel expense |
| Office space | May be separate from worship venue |
| Storage | For portable church equipment |
| Utilities | May be included in rent or separate |
| Insurance | Liability, property, workers' compensation |

### Equipment

| Item | Considerations |
|------|---------------|
| Sound system | Main PA, monitors, microphones |
| Video projection | Projector, screens, switching equipment |
| Lighting | Stage lighting, controllers |
| Staging | Risers, pipe and drape, backdrops |
| Children's ministry | Age-appropriate equipment and supplies |
| Operations | Signage, hospitality, check-in systems |
| Storage/transport | Trailer, carts, cases |

See the Purchasing section of this wiki for detailed equipment guides.

### Ministry Operations

| Item | Considerations |
|------|---------------|
| Curriculum | Children's ministry, small group materials |
| Supplies | Office, worship, hospitality |
| Printing | Bulletins, promotional materials, signage |
| Software | Church management, accounting, presentation |
| Website | Hosting, domain, design |

### Promotion

| Item | Considerations |
|------|---------------|
| Pre-launch promotion | Mailers, signage, digital advertising |
| Ongoing promotion | Continued advertising after launch |
| Branding | Logo, design work |

### Administration

| Item | Considerations |
|------|---------------|
| Accounting services | Bookkeeping, tax preparation |
| Legal services | If needed beyond incorporation |
| Bank fees | Monthly fees, transaction costs |
| Miscellaneous | Unexpected expenses (budget 5-10% contingency) |

### Denominational/Network

| Item | Considerations |
|------|---------------|
| Church planting contribution | Commitment to fund future plants (typically 5% of budget) |
| Training and conferences | Required or recommended events |

## Sample Budget Framework

This framework shows typical percentage allocations. Your specific situation will vary.

| Category | Percentage Range |
|----------|-----------------|
| Personnel | 40-60% |
| Facilities | 15-25% |
| Equipment (year one) | 10-20% |
| Ministry operations | 5-10% |
| Promotion | 5-10% |
| Administration | 3-5% |
| Denominational/Network | 5% |
| Contingency | 5-10% |

<Callout type="warning">
  Equipment costs in year one will be significantly higher than in subsequent years. Don't let this distort your long-term budget expectations.

## Cash Flow Considerations

A budget shows total expected income and expenses. Cash flow considers the *timing* of money in and out.

### Key Cash Flow Factors

**Giving patterns** — Giving often spikes around Easter and year-end, with slower summer months.

**Large purchases** — Equipment purchases may require payment before you've collected sufficient offerings.

**Lease deposits** — Facilities often require several months' rent as deposit.

**Payroll consistency** — Staff expect regular, predictable paychecks regardless of giving fluctuations.

### Building Cash Reserves

Aim to maintain 2-3 months of operating expenses in reserve. This provides:
- Buffer for slow giving periods
- Ability to cover unexpected expenses
- Confidence for staff and vendors

---

## Budget Management

Creating a budget is only the beginning. Ongoing management ensures you stay on track.

### Monthly Review

Compare actual income and expenses to budget monthly. Look for:
- Categories significantly over or under budget
- Trends that suggest future problems
- One-time variances vs. ongoing issues

### Quarterly Adjustment

Review the full budget quarterly with your leadership team. Make adjustments based on:
- Actual giving patterns
- Changed circumstances
- New opportunities or needs

### Annual Planning

Begin the next year's budget planning 2-3 months before year-end. Use actual data from the current year to inform projections.

## Working with Your Coach

Your coach is a valuable resource throughout the budget process. They can:

- Provide templates and sample budgets
- Review your assumptions for realism
- Suggest cost-saving strategies
- Connect you with vendors offering church plant discounts
- Approve major purchases and commitments

<Callout type="tip">
  Don't wait until you've finished your budget to involve your coach. Bring them in early to avoid wasted effort on unrealistic plans.
</Callout>

## Common Budgeting Mistakes

**Overestimating income** — Faith is important, but so is realism. Base projections on actual commitments, not hopes.

**Underestimating equipment costs** — Get actual quotes, not guesses. Equipment consistently costs more than anticipated.

**Forgetting hidden costs** — Insurance, taxes, software subscriptions, and small purchases add up quickly.

**No contingency** — Unexpected expenses are guaranteed. Budget for them.

**Ignoring cash flow** — A balanced annual budget doesn't help if you can't make payroll in month six.
