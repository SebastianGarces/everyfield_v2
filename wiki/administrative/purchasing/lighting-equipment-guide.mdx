Lighting shapes atmosphere more than most people realize. The right lighting makes your space feel warm and inviting, focuses attention where it belongs, and transforms a rented gymnasium into a place of worship. This guide helps you select lighting that enhances your services without overwhelming your budget or volunteers.

## Why Lighting Matters

### Atmosphere Creation

Lighting sets emotional tone before a word is spoken or a note is sung:

- Warm lighting creates intimacy
- Focused lighting creates emphasis
- Dim lighting creates reverence
- Bright lighting creates energy

### Focus Direction

Light draws the eye. Proper lighting directs attention to:

- The worship team during singing
- The pastor during the message
- The screen during announcements
- The response area during invitation

### Space Transformation

Portable churches meet in spaces designed for other purposes. Lighting can:

- Hide distracting elements
- Create visual boundaries
- Add color and interest
- Make the space feel intentional

  You don't need concert lighting to be effective. Even modest, well-placed lighting dramatically improves the worship environment.

## Lighting Basics

### Types of Stage Lighting

| Type | Purpose | Characteristics |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| **Wash** | General coverage | Broad, even light over area |
| **Spot** | Focused attention | Narrow beam, single subject |
| **Accent** | Visual interest | Color, texture, effects |
| **Practical** | Functional | Stands, lectern lights |

### Key Concepts

**Color Temperature**
Measured in Kelvin (K):
- 2700-3000K: Warm (amber/orange)
- 4000-5000K: Neutral (white)
- 5500-6500K: Cool (blue-white)

Most worship environments use warm to neutral lighting for a welcoming feel.

**Lumens and Intensity**
More lumens = more light output. Stage lighting needs to compete with ambient light while providing even coverage.

**DMX Control**
DMX512 is the standard protocol for controlling lighting equipment. A DMX controller communicates with fixtures via DMX cables, allowing:
- Intensity control
- Color changes
- Movement (for moving fixtures)
- Automated scene recall

---

## Equipment Components

### LED Fixtures

LED has become the standard for portable church lighting:

**LED PAR Cans (Wash)**
- Primary workhorse fixtures
- RGB or RGBW color mixing
- Low heat, low power consumption
- Affordable and durable

**LED Profiles/Ellipsoidals (Spot)**
- Focused, shaped beam
- Good for pastor/lectern
- Higher cost than PAR
- Essential for key positions

**LED Bars/Battens**
- Long, linear fixtures
- Good for color washes
- Backdrop lighting
- Compact transport

### Control Equipment

**DMX Controller**
Options range from:
- Simple scene controllers (affordable, limited)
- Software-based control (flexible, learning curve)
- Professional consoles (powerful, expensive)

For most portable churches, a simple scene controller or software solution provides adequate control without excessive complexity.

**DMX Distribution**
- DMX cables connect fixtures in daisy-chain
- DMX splitters for multiple runs
- Wireless DMX for difficult cable runs

### Support Equipment

**Trussing**
- Provides mounting points for fixtures
- Ground-supported or flown (if facility allows)
- Portable aluminum truss systems available
- Consider weight and setup time

**Stands**
- Tripod stands for individual fixtures
- Cheaper than truss
- Less professional appearance
- Adequate for smaller setups

**Clamps and Hardware**
- Safety cables always required
- Appropriate clamps for fixtures
- Gel frames if needed
- Organization accessories

## System Configurations

### Minimal Setup

For tight budgets or simple needs:

```
4-6 LED PAR cans (warm wash)
1-2 LED spots (pastor/lectern)
Simple scene controller
Basic stands
```

Budget: $1,000-2,500

This provides basic stage visibility and some atmosphere control.

### Standard Setup

For most portable churches:

```
8-12 LED PAR cans (wash, various positions)
2-4 LED spots (key positions)
LED color wash for backdrop
DMX controller with scene recall
Basic truss or stands
```

Budget: $3,000-7,000

This enables worship-specific looks, good coverage, and some visual interest.

### Enhanced Setup

For larger venues or higher production values:

```
16+ LED PAR cans
4+ LED spots
LED bars/battens for effects
Moving head fixtures (optional)
Professional controller
Full truss system
```

Budget: $8,000-20,000+

<Callout type="warning">
  Start simpler than you think you need. It's easier to add fixtures than to manage complexity you're not ready for.
</Callout>

## Positioning and Design

### Basic Positions

**Front Light**
- Lights faces from front
- Essential for visibility
- Position at 45° angle from subject
- Use spots for key positions, wash for general

**Back Light**
- Creates depth and separation
- Positions behind/above subjects
- Can be colored for effect
- Helps subjects "pop" from background

**Side Light**
- Adds dimension
- Creates drama and texture
- Less common in simple setups
- Good for worship team separation

### Coverage Zones

Divide your stage into zones for independent control:

| Zone | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Center stage | Pastor, main focus |
| Stage left | Worship team section |
| Stage right | Worship team section |
| Backdrop | Color wash, visual interest |
| Screen area | Video visibility |

### Avoiding Problems

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **Hot spots** | Overlap fixture coverage |
| **Shadows on faces** | Add front fill light |
| **Spill on screen** | Position/focus carefully |
| **Uneven coverage** | Add fixtures, reposition |

## Working with Ambient Light

Portable church venues often have problematic ambient light:

### Common Challenges

- Windows letting in daylight
- Fluorescent overhead lights
- Exit signs and safety lights
- Reflective surfaces

### Mitigation Strategies

**For Windows:**
- Choose venues with window coverings
- Bring temporary blackout material
- Schedule services around sun position
- Accept some compromise during daytime

**For Overhead Lights:**
- Request they be turned off during service
- Some facilities allow partial control
- Your lighting must be bright enough to compensate

**For Safety Lights:**
- Cannot be turned off (code requirement)
- Position fixtures to minimize visibility
- Accept them as necessary

<Callout type="tip">
  Visit your venue at the time services will occur. Light conditions at 10 AM Sunday are different from 6 PM Wednesday.
</Callout>

## Setup and Operation

### Setup Workflow

```
1. Set up truss/stands in planned positions
2. Mount and secure fixtures (safety cables!)
3. Run DMX and power cables
4. Connect controller
5. Power on and address fixtures
6. Focus and aim each fixture
7. Program scenes
8. Test and adjust
```

### Scene Programming

Create preset scenes for different service moments:

| Scene | Purpose | Characteristics |
|-------|---------|-----------------|
| **Pre-service** | Gathering | Warm, inviting, medium level |
| **Worship up** | Energetic songs | Brighter, full color |
| **Worship down** | Reflective songs | Dimmer, warm, focused |
| **Message** | Pastor speaking | Center focus, reduced color |
| **Response** | Invitation/prayer | Subdued, intimate |
| **Dismiss** | After service | Return to pre-service |

### Operational Tips

- Save scenes and back up controller settings
- Label fixtures and positions consistently
- Document your setup with diagrams
- Train multiple operators
- Do lighting check before every service

## Training Requirements

### Skills to Develop

| Skill | Who Needs It |
|-------|--------------|
| Basic operation (run scenes) | All lighting team |
| Scene programming | Team leads |
| Setup and focus | All team members |
| Troubleshooting | Technical lead |
| Design principles | Lead designer |

### Common Operator Mistakes

- Changing lights too abruptly
- Distracting movement during message
