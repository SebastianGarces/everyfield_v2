Visual communication enhances every aspect of your service—from worship lyrics that free people to lift their eyes, to sermon graphics that reinforce key points, to announcements that inform without taking stage time. This guide helps you select projection equipment that serves your portable church needs.

## Why Video Matters

### Worship Engagement

When lyrics are clear and readable, worshippers can focus on God rather than squinting at a screen or fumbling with a hymnal. Good projection enables participation.

### Communication Efficiency

Announcements, scripture references, and sermon points displayed visually reinforce verbal communication and reduce the need for lengthy explanations.

### Professional Impression

Clean, well-executed visuals communicate that your church cares about quality and pays attention to details—even in a temporary facility.

### Guest Accessibility

New guests may not know your songs or where to find scripture. On-screen display makes everyone an insider from their first visit.

<Callout type="tip">
  Video projection is about communication, not entertainment. Keep your focus on clarity and readability rather than flashy effects.

## Selecting a Projector

### Brightness Requirements

Ambient light is your enemy. In most portable church scenarios:

| Environment | Minimum Lumens |
|-------------|---------------|
| Dark room, controlled lighting | 3,000-4,000 |
| Some ambient light | 5,000-6,000 |
| Significant ambient light | 7,000-10,000 |
| Windows, high ambient | 10,000+ or LED walls |

**For most portable churches, 5,000-7,000 lumens is the sweet spot**—enough brightness for various conditions without excessive cost.

### Projector Technologies

| Technology | Characteristics |
|------------|----------------|
| **LCD** | Good color, sharp text, affordable, lamp replacement |
| **DLP** | Good contrast, smooth motion, compact, some color wheel issues |
| **Laser** | No lamp replacement, instant on, higher cost |

Laser projectors are increasingly cost-effective and eliminate lamp replacement costs—worth considering despite higher initial price.

### Resolution and Aspect Ratio

- **1080p (1920x1080)** — Standard for most applications
- **4K (3840x2160)** — Overkill for most text-based content
- **16:9 aspect ratio** — Standard widescreen, matches most content

### Features to Prioritize

Essential:
- Adequate lumens for your venue
- 1080p resolution minimum
- HDMI input
- Lens shift (vertical at minimum)
- Zoom lens for placement flexibility

Helpful:
- Multiple inputs
- Network control
- Quick startup/shutdown
- Horizontal lens shift
- Quiet operation

## Screen Selection

### Size Calculation

Screen should be large enough for back-row readability:

**Rule of thumb:** Maximum viewing distance = 6-8x screen height

| Screen Width | Readable Distance |
|--------------|-------------------|
| 100" (87" W) | Up to 40-50 feet |
| 120" (105" W) | Up to 50-60 feet |
| 150" (131" W) | Up to 60-75 feet |
| 180" (157" W) | Up to 75-90 feet |

Err on the side of larger—text that's too small frustrates viewers.

### Screen Types for Portable Use

**Tripod Screens**
- Easiest to transport
- Limited to ~100" typically
- Can be unstable
- Best for smaller venues

**Fast-Fold Frames**
- Professional appearance
- Larger sizes available
- More setup time
- Higher quality surface

**Pipe and Drape Integration**
- Can hang screen from drape structure
- Flexible positioning
- Requires compatible screen material
- May need tensioning system

<Callout type="warning">
  Wall projection rarely works well. Wall color, texture, and angles all degrade image quality. Invest in a proper screen.
</Callout>

### Screen Surface Types

| Surface | Best For | Gain |
|---------|----------|------|
| **Matte white** | Wide viewing angles | 1.0 |
| **High contrast grey** | Ambient light | 0.8-1.0 |
| **High gain** | Maximum brightness | 1.3-2.5 |
| **Rear projection** | Special applications | Varies |

For most portable churches, a matte white or high-contrast grey surface works well.

## Confidence Monitors

### Purpose

Confidence monitors show presenters what the audience sees, plus additional information:

- Lyrics so worship leaders don't turn around
- Sermon notes for the pastor
- Countdown timers for service flow
- Stage directions or cues

### Common Configuration

| Location | Content | Size |
|----------|---------|------|
| Floor, center stage | Lyrics, notes | 40-55" |
| Side stage | Lyrics, cues | 32-40" |
| Back of room | Stage view | Optional |

### Equipment Options

- **LCD TVs** — Affordable, versatile, available everywhere
- **Dedicated monitors** — More robust for transport
- **Tablets** — Personal monitoring option

Most presentation software supports multiple outputs to send different content to confidence monitors than main screen.

## Playback and Software

### Presentation Software Options

| Software | Platform | Strengths |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| **ProPresenter** | Mac/Windows | Industry standard, powerful, learning curve |
| **EasyWorship** | Windows | Church-focused, easier learning curve |
| **MediaShout** | Windows | Long history, worship-focused |
| **OpenLP** | Cross-platform | Free, open-source, adequate features |
| **PowerPoint** | Mac/Windows | Universal, basic for worship |

ProPresenter has become the de facto standard for contemporary churches, but EasyWorship and others are excellent options with easier learning curves.

### Computer Requirements

Whatever software you choose:

- Dedicated computer (not dual-use)
- Solid-state drive for reliability
- Adequate RAM (16GB recommended)
- Dedicated graphics capability
- Multiple video outputs

### Backup Strategy

Always have a backup plan:

- Second computer with content loaded
- USB drive with exported content
- Printed lyrics for emergencies
- Clear handoff procedures

<Callout type="insight">
  The computer running lyrics is as critical as the projector. Treat it as essential equipment, not an afterthought.
</Callout>

## Signal Distribution

### Cable Types and Distances

| Cable Type | Maximum Distance | Notes |
|------------|------------------|-------|
| HDMI (passive) | 15-25 feet | Quality varies |
| HDMI (active) | 50+ feet | Built-in boosting |
| HDMI over Cat6 | 150+ feet | Requires converters |
| SDI | 300+ feet | Professional standard |

For most portable setups, active HDMI cables or HDMI-over-Cat6 systems provide the best balance of quality, reliability, and cost.

### Distribution Equipment

**HDMI Splitter**
- Takes one input, creates multiple identical outputs
- Useful for projector + confidence monitor
- Ensure HDCP compliance

**HDMI Switcher**
- Multiple inputs, one output
- Useful for computer + video source
- Can be manual or automatic

**Scalers/Converters**
- Convert between formats (VGA to HDMI, etc.)
- Scale resolution for compatibility
- Useful for legacy equipment

## Setup and Positioning

### Projector Placement

**Front projection** (projector behind audience):
- Most common for portable use
- Requires clear throw path
- Audience between projector and screen
- Keystoning correction may be needed

**Rear projection** (projector behind screen):
- Cleaner look, no visible equipment
- Requires space behind screen
- Special screen material needed
- Less common for portable

### Avoiding Problems

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **Shadows on screen** | Position projector higher, use longer throw |
| **Keystone distortion** | Level projector, use lens shift |
| **Hot spots** | Choose appropriate screen gain |
| **Color accuracy** | Calibrate projector, check content |

### Screen Positioning

- Center screen for primary viewing
- Height allows clear sightlines
- Far enough from seating for wide viewing angle
- Consider dual screens for wide rooms

## Budget Considerations

### Sample Budget Ranges

| Component | Entry | Mid-Range | Professional |
|-----------|-------|-----------|--------------|
| Projector (5000-7000L) | $1,500-3,000 | $3,000-6,000 | $6,000-15,000 |
| Screen (100-150") | $200-500 | $500-1,500 | $1,500-3,000 |
| Playback computer | $800-1,200 | $1,200-2,000 | $2,000+ |
| Software | $0-500 | $500-1,500 | Included above |
| Confidence monitors | $200-400 | $400-800 | $800-1,500 |
| Cables/distribution | $100-300 | $300-600 | $600-1,000 |
| **Total** | **$2,800-5,900** | **$5,900-12,400** | **$12,400-24,500** |

### Where to Invest

- **Projector brightness** — You can't add lumens later
- **Quality screen** — Dramatically affects image
- **Reliable cabling** — Failures are embarrassing

### Where to Save

- Confidence monitors (consumer TVs work fine)
- Computer (adequate is sufficient)
- Cases (functional over fancy)
