Before diving into tactics and timelines, you need clarity on what success looks like. A successful church launch isn't just about getting people in the room on Sunday—it's about building something that can bear fruit for years to come.

This article defines the primary objectives and 8 key goals that should drive every decision in your launch process.

---

## Primary Objectives

Two overarching objectives should guide your entire launch:

### Objective 1: Launch with the Right People

**Launch the church with a cohesive, mature group of 50-100 adult believers fully aligned with the vision, mission, and distinctives.**

Notice what this objective emphasizes:

| Element | Why It Matters |
|---------|----------------|
| **Cohesive** | Unity enables effective ministry and healthy conflict resolution |
| **Mature** | Spiritual maturity provides stability when challenges come |
| **50-100 adults** | Critical mass creates momentum and sustainability |
| **Fully aligned** | Shared vision prevents future conflict and enables focused effort |

<Callout type="warning">
  Launching with fewer people who are deeply committed is better than launching
  with more people who aren't aligned. Quality precedes quantity.
</Callout>

### Objective 2: Launch with Execution Capability

**Launch the church in such a way that it can bear fruit quickly by fully executing the ministry model for discipleship (ministry funnel).**

A successful launch isn't just an event—it's the beginning of effective, ongoing ministry. Your Launch Sunday should demonstrate that you can:

- Execute a high-impact worship service
- Assimilate new guests effectively
- Connect people into meaningful community
- Develop disciples through your ministry funnel

If you can do these things on day one, you'll build momentum. If you can't, you'll spend your first year playing catch-up.

## The 8 Key Objectives

These 8 objectives translate the primary goals into measurable targets:

### 1. Grow the Launch Team to 50-100 Adult Believers

This is the foundation. Everything else depends on having enough committed people to execute effectively.

**What "adult believers" means:**
- Not just attendees—committed participants
- Not just warm bodies—people with the 4 C's (Committed, Compelled, Contagious, Courageous)
- Not just individuals—often couples and families

### 2. Secure Facilities

You need three types of space:
- **Worship services** — Where you'll gather on Sundays
- **Office space** — For administrative operations and meetings
- **Storage** — For equipment between services

<Callout type="tip">
  Start looking for facilities early. Finding the right space often takes longer
  than expected, and you don't want facility delays to push back your launch.
</Callout>

### 3. Execute a High-Impact Service and Ministry Funnel

Launch Sunday must demonstrate excellence. This means:
- Compelling worship
- Clear, powerful preaching
- Smooth guest experience
- Effective children's ministry
- Clear next steps for visitors

The ministry funnel should be operational from day one—not something you'll "figure out later."

### 4. Have Finances in Place

Launching a church requires capital. You need:
- Adequate funds for equipment purchases
- Operating budget for first-year expenses
- Emergency reserves for unexpected costs
- Systems for collecting, counting, and disbursing funds

### 5. Purchase Equipment

A portable church requires significant equipment:
- Sound system
- Video projection
- Lighting
- Signage
- Children's ministry supplies
- Storage and transport solutions

All equipment should arrive, be tested, and be operational before launch.

### 6. Complete Training for Key Responsibilities

Every volunteer role requires training:
- Set-up and tear-down teams
- Greeters and ushers
- Children's ministry workers
- Worship and production team
- Assimilation team

Training isn't optional—it's what separates amateur execution from professional excellence.

### 7. Execute Promotional Plan

People need to know you exist. Your promotional plan might include:
- Social media presence
- Direct mail
- Invitation cards
- Community connections
- Partner church announcements

The goal isn't just awareness—it's targeted awareness that brings the right people on Launch Sunday.

### 8. Establish Ministry Teams

By launch, these teams should be functional:

| Team | Primary Responsibility |
|------|----------------------|
| **Worship Leader and team** | Lead corporate worship |
| **Children's Ministry** | Serve families with excellence |
| **Assimilation** | Connect guests to the church |
| **Small Groups** | Facilitate community and discipleship |
| **Administration/Finance** | Handle operations and money |
| **Facilities** | Manage setup, teardown, and space |
| **Promotion** | Communicate to the community |
| **Technology** | Support technical needs |

## How the Objectives Connect

These 8 objectives aren't independent checkboxes—they're interconnected:

```
PEOPLE (50-100 believers)
    ↓
enables
    ↓
MINISTRY TEAMS → TRAINING → EXECUTION
    ↓
supported by
    ↓
FACILITIES + EQUIPMENT + FINANCES + PROMOTION
```

You can't have trained ministry teams without people. You can't execute effectively without facilities and equipment. You can't sustain operations without finances.

Start with people. Build teams. Provide resources. Execute with excellence.

## Measuring Progress

As you move through the launch process, regularly assess your progress against these 8 objectives:

- [ ] Launch team at 50+ adults (target: 100)
- [ ] Worship facility secured
- [ ] Office space identified
- [ ] Storage solution in place
- [ ] Service run-through completed successfully
- [ ] Ministry funnel documented and tested
- [ ] Budget funded and financial systems operational
- [ ] All major equipment purchased and tested
- [ ] All team leaders trained
- [ ] All volunteers trained in their roles
- [ ] Promotional plan executed
- [ ] All 8 ministry teams functional

<Callout type="important">
  If you're significantly behind on any objective as your launch date
  approaches, consider whether to delay. A delayed launch done well is better
  than a premature launch done poorly.
</Callout>

Count the cost. Set clear goals. Then pursue them with faith and excellence.
