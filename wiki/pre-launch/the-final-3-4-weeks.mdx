With Launch Sunday **3-4 weeks away**, you've entered the final stretch. This isn't the time for new initiatives—it's the time to integrate, refine, and polish everything you've been building.

Your training should be 90-100% complete. Your teams should know their roles. Now it's about bringing all the pieces together into a unified, well-rehearsed operation.

---

## The Mindset Shift

Up until now, you've been building—recruiting Core Group members, forming teams, acquiring equipment, and training leaders. The final 3-4 weeks require a different mindset:

**From building to refining.**

Think of this window like a dress rehearsal for a major production. The script is written, the actors know their lines, the sets are built. Now you practice until everything flows seamlessly.

<Callout type="insight">
  This window is about integration, not introduction. You're not teaching new 
  concepts—you're helping teams work together as a unified whole.

## Three Primary Priorities

The final 3-4 weeks focus on three critical areas:

### 1. Operations

All set-up equipment needed for launch must arrive in this window. Your facilities team conducts intensive hands-on training. The goal: every person knows their role, every piece of equipment has a place, and set-up/tear-down becomes second nature.

### 2. Launch Team Preparation

The spiritual dimension intensifies. This is the time for focused prayer, fasting, and drawing near to the Lord together. You'll also conduct Pre-Launch Services—full rehearsals that let every team practice in real conditions.

### 3. Promotion Plan

Three to four weeks out triggers the full launch of your promotion plan. Get the word out to as many people as possible using every channel available to you.

## The Weekly Rhythm

Here's how these final weeks typically flow:

| Week | Focus |
|------|-------|
| **Week 4** | Equipment arrives, In-Service Training Day, promotion launches |
| **Week 3** | First Pre-Launch Service, refine operations, prayer intensifies |
| **Week 2** | Second Pre-Launch Service, work out issues, continue promotion |
| **Week 1** | Final Pre-Launch Service, final checklist review, celebration and prayer |

<Callout type="warning">
  Don't try to cram new training into these final weeks. If a team isn't ready 
  by now, simplify their responsibilities rather than rushing their preparation.
</Callout>

## What Happens in This Window

### Equipment & Setup

All portable church equipment arrives and is inspected. Your In-Service Training Day teaches everyone the proper way to set up, tear down, and care for equipment.

### Pre-Launch Services

Three services (typically Sunday evenings) give every team real practice:
- Set-up and tear-down teams work together
- Worship team leads actual services
- Children's ministry runs their full program
- Assimilation processes are tested
- Senior Pastor delivers Peak Performance teaching

### Prayer & Fasting

Schedule one day per week for fasting, ending with corporate worship and prayer followed by a shared meal. The Senior Pastor leads this spiritual emphasis.

### Promotion Execution

Your promotion plan goes live. Social media, invitation cards, personal invitations—everything launches to build awareness and anticipation.

---

## Keys to Success

### Stay Calm

Things will go wrong during Pre-Launch Services. That's the point—find the problems now, not on Launch Sunday. Approach issues with curiosity, not panic.

### Communicate Constantly

Over-communicate during this window. Send weekly updates. Hold brief team leader check-ins. Make sure everyone knows what's happening and what's expected.

### Protect Your Senior Pastor

The Senior Pastor needs margin during these weeks for sermon preparation, prayer, and leadership. Don't let administrative details consume all their time and energy.

### Celebrate Progress

Take moments to acknowledge how far you've come. Celebrate the team. Express gratitude to God. This builds momentum and morale heading into launch.

<Callout type="tip">
  Keep a running list of every issue that surfaces during Pre-Launch Services. 
  Address each one before the next rehearsal. By Launch Sunday, you'll have 
  worked through most potential problems.
</Callout>

## The Final Week

The week before Launch Sunday is special. By now, you've done everything you can to prepare. The final week is about:

1. **Final checklist review** — Every team confirms readiness
2. **Rest** — Encourage the team to get adequate sleep
3. **Prayer** — Intense intercession for Launch Sunday
4. **Celebration** — Acknowledge the journey and thank God together
