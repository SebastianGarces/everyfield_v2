For most church plants, you're setting up and tearing down every single week. What seems like a logistical burden is actually an opportunity—an opportunity for your team to serve together, build community, and demonstrate excellence in even the mundane.

The key is **systems**. With good systems, set-up becomes smooth and even enjoyable. Without them, it's chaotic and exhausting.

## Why Operations Matter

Set-up and tear-down may not seem spiritual, but they set the tone for everything else. When guests arrive to a well-prepared space, they sense care and excellence. When the team is frazzled and running behind, that stress permeates the entire morning.

<Callout type="insight">
  Excellence in operations communicates value. When people see a well-organized, 
  thoughtfully prepared environment, they sense that what happens here matters.

## The Equipment Arrives

All set-up equipment needed to launch should arrive **3-4 weeks before Launch Sunday**. This timing gives you enough runway to:

1. Inspect everything for damage or missing items
2. Learn how to properly use each piece
3. Practice set-up and tear-down multiple times
4. Identify and resolve any issues

### Equipment Categories

Your portable church equipment typically includes:

| Category | Key Items |
|----------|-----------|
| **Audio** | Speakers, mixer, microphones, cables, stands |
| **Video** | Projector, screen, playback computer, cables |
| **Lighting** | LED fixtures, controller, trussing |
| **Staging** | Platforms, pipe and drape, banners |
| **Signage** | External signs, directional signs, welcome banners |
| **Children's** | Dividers, rugs, check-in station, age-appropriate items |
| **Hospitality** | Coffee cart, welcome table, supplies |
| **Storage** | Cargo trailer, cases, organization systems |

## Building Your Set-up System

### Create a Master Equipment List

Document every piece of equipment with:
- Item name and description
- Storage location
- Set-up location
- Responsible team member

### Develop Station-Based Set-up

Divide the worship space into stations, each with a team responsible:

| Station | Responsibility |
|---------|----------------|
| **Stage** | Platforms, instruments, monitors, music stands |
| **Audio** | Speakers, mixer, cables, microphones |
| **Video** | Projector, screen, playback computer |
| **Lighting** | Fixtures, controller, any special effects |
| **Welcome** | Entry signage, welcome table, coffee station |
| **Seating** | Chairs arranged properly, aisles clear |
| **Children's** | All children's ministry spaces set up |

### Establish Clear Timelines

Set-up should be completed **at least 30 minutes** before the first team members need the space for sound check or prayer. Work backward from your service time:

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 6:00 AM | Set-up team arrives, trailer unloaded |
| 7:00 AM | All stations set up |
| 7:30 AM | Sound check begins |
| 8:00 AM | Worship team rehearsal |
| 8:45 AM | All teams in position |
| 9:00 AM | Doors open |

<Callout type="warning">
  Never assume set-up will go smoothly. Build buffer time into your schedule 
  for unexpected issues. It's better to be ready early than scrambling at service time.
</Callout>

## Tear-down Excellence

Tear-down is just as important as set-up. How you break down and store equipment determines how easy next week's set-up will be.

### Tear-down Principles

1. **Everything has a home** — Every piece of equipment has a specific place in storage
2. **Pack for set-up** — Organize storage so things come out in set-up order
3. **Inspect as you go** — Note any damaged or worn items during tear-down
4. **Clean as you go** — Leave the facility better than you found it
5. **Celebrate together** — Tear-down is part of the worship experience

### Post-Service Timeline

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| End of Service | Congregation dismissed, team briefed |
| +15 minutes | Tear-down begins |
| +45 minutes | All equipment packed and loaded |
| +60 minutes | Facility walkthrough complete |
| +75 minutes | Trailer secured, team dismissed |

## Working with Your Facility

Your relationship with the facility owner is precious. Protect it through excellence in operations.

### Facility Care Checklist

- [ ] Return all furniture to original positions
- [ ] Clean any spills or messes
- [ ] Take out any trash you generated
- [ ] Check bathrooms used by your congregation
- [ ] Lock all doors and set alarms as required
- [ ] Note any facility issues to report to the owner

<Callout type="tip">
  Occasionally leave a small gift for the facility staff—a thank you card, 
  coffee gift cards, or treats. These gestures build goodwill and demonstrate 
  that you value the partnership.
</Callout>

## Team Roles and Rotation

### Core Team vs. Rotation

Some positions require consistency (team leader, audio engineer), while others can rotate to distribute the load and develop more people.

| Position | Consistency Level |
|----------|-------------------|
| Facilities Leader | High — same person weekly |
| Audio Engineer | High — trained individuals only |
| Station Leads | Medium — small rotation of trained people |
| General Set-up | Low — can rotate broadly |

### Recruiting for Set-up

Set-up and tear-down teams often attract people who:
- Like practical, hands-on service
- Prefer behind-the-scenes roles
- Enjoy physical activity
- Want to serve but aren't comfortable in public roles

Frame set-up as meaningful ministry, not just manual labor. These servants make everything else possible.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Equipment arrives damaged | Have backup plans; know rental options |
| Key team member absent | Cross-train so multiple people can cover each role |
| Facility conflict | Communicate early; have backup date/time for set-up |
| Running behind schedule | Know what can be skipped vs. what's essential |
| Equipment failure | Keep spare cables, batteries, and basic repair supplies |

---

## Documentation

Create written documentation for your operations:

1. **Equipment inventory** — Complete list with photos
2. **Set-up guide** — Step-by-step instructions with diagrams
3. **Tear-down guide** — Breakdown procedures and storage map
4. **Contact list** — Team members, facility contacts, equipment vendors
5. **Troubleshooting guide** — Common problems and solutions

This documentation enables consistency even when key team members are absent.

<Callout type="scripture">
  *"Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men, knowing 
  that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward. You are 
  serving the Lord Christ."* — Colossians 3:23-24
</Callout>

Set-up and tear-down are acts of worship. When done with excellence and joy, they honor the Lord and serve His people. Every cable coiled, every chair placed, every sign positioned is service to Christ.
