Pre-Launch Services are full dress rehearsals held in the weeks before Launch Sunday. They give every team the opportunity to practice in real conditions, working out problems before they happen in front of guests.

Think of Pre-Launch Services as final exams with a twist—you get to take them multiple times, and every mistake is a learning opportunity.

## Why Pre-Launch Services Are Essential

Practice makes progress. Pre-Launch Services accomplish what no amount of training or discussion can:

1. **Real conditions** — Teams operate in the actual space with actual equipment
2. **Team integration** — All ministries work together simultaneously
3. **Problem discovery** — Issues surface before Launch Sunday
4. **Confidence building** — Success in practice builds confidence for launch
5. **Worship experience** — The team experiences the service from the inside

<Callout type="insight">
  Pre-Launch Services are invaluable precisely because things go wrong. Each 
  problem solved now is one less problem on Launch Sunday.

## How Many and When

Schedule **three Pre-Launch Services** in the three weeks before Launch Sunday:

| Week | Service | Primary Focus |
|------|---------|---------------|
| Week 3 | Pre-Launch 1 | Basic integration, working out major issues |
| Week 2 | Pre-Launch 2 | Refinement, timing, transitions |
| Week 1 | Pre-Launch 3 | Final polish, confidence, celebration |

### Best Time Slots

Saturday evening or Sunday evening typically works best:
- Doesn't conflict with other church services
- Allows use of the actual worship space
- Builds rhythm for weekly services

Coordinate with your facility to secure these dates early.

---

## Who Attends

Pre-Launch Services are for the **Launch Team only**—not guests. This allows:

- Freedom to stop and restart
- Open discussion of problems
- Teaching moments without embarrassment
- Focus on process, not public presentation

### Attendance Expectations

| Team | Attendance |
|------|------------|
| Facilities/Set-up | All members required |
| Worship/Production | All members required |
| Children's Ministry | All members required |
| Assimilation | All members required |
| Small Groups | Leaders encouraged |
| Prayer Team | All members required |
| Launch Team families | Encouraged (especially for children's ministry practice) |

## What Happens During Pre-Launch Services

Each Pre-Launch Service serves multiple purposes simultaneously:

### Set-up and Tear-down Practice

The full facilities team arrives early to set up as they will on Launch Sunday. After the service, they tear down completely. This practice is invaluable.

### Worship Team Integration

The worship team leads actual worship—songs, transitions, media, lighting. They practice the full production, not just individual parts.

### Senior Pastor Teaching

The Senior Pastor typically delivers Peak Performance teaching during Pre-Launch Services:

| Service | Teaching |
|---------|----------|
| Pre-Launch 1 | Peak Performance I — Vision, mission, values |
| Pre-Launch 2 | Peak Performance II — Beliefs and doctrine |
| Pre-Launch 3 | Peak Performance III — Commitment and next steps |

This accomplishes two things: the Pastor practices preaching in the space, and the Launch Team receives foundational membership teaching.

### Children's Ministry Dry Run

Children's ministry runs their full program:
- Check-in procedures tested
- Curriculum delivered
- Safety protocols practiced
- Dismissal procedures refined

Encourage Launch Team members with children to bring their kids for realistic practice.

### Assimilation Testing

Practice the full guest assimilation process:
- Greeting stations
- Connection cards
- Database entry
- Follow-up assignments

Have team members role-play as guests to test the system.

Here's a sample schedule for a Sunday evening Pre-Launch Service:

| 4:30 PM | Set-up complete, sound check begins |

| 9:00 PM | Facility cleared |

---

## Conducting the Debrief

The debrief after each Pre-Launch Service is critical. This is where learning happens.

### Debrief Format

1. **Gather all team leaders** (and any team members who want to participate)
2. **Celebrate wins** — Start with what went well
3. **Identify issues** — What problems surfaced?
4. **Assign ownership** — Who will fix each issue?
5. **Set timeline** — When will it be resolved?
6. **Pray together** — Commit the work to the Lord

### Debrief Questions

Ask each ministry leader:
- What went well for your team?
- What problems did you encounter?
- What do you need that you don't have?
- What will you do differently next week?

<Callout type="warning">
  Don't skip the debrief when you're tired. The learning from a debrief is 
  more valuable than the practice itself. Capture it while it's fresh.
</Callout>

### Issue Tracking

Keep a running list of issues across all Pre-Launch Services:

| Issue | Owner | Status | Notes |
|-------|-------|--------|-------|
| Projector focus blurry | Tech Leader | Resolved | Adjusted lens |
| Check-in printer jammed | Children's | In Progress | Ordered new printer |
| Transition music too quiet | Worship | Resolved | Adjusted mixer settings |

Review this list before each Pre-Launch Service. Confirm resolved items and prioritize remaining issues.

## Tips for Effective Pre-Launch Services

### Create Real Conditions

The more realistic, the better. Use the actual equipment, follow the actual schedule, and respond to actual problems.

### Allow for Mistakes

This is practice. When something goes wrong, stop if needed, discuss the issue, and try again. There's no audience to please.

### Progress Each Week

Pre-Launch 1 will be rough. Pre-Launch 2 should be smoother. Pre-Launch 3 should feel almost ready. If you're not progressing, identify what's blocking improvement.

### Invite Feedback

Create an environment where anyone can speak up. The volunteer who notices a problem is helping, not criticizing.

### Celebrate Improvement

Acknowledge progress between services. "Last week we had 12 issues. This week we had 4. That's amazing progress!"

<Callout type="tip">
  Video record at least one Pre-Launch Service. Watching the recording reveals 
  things you miss in the moment—transitions, timing, facility presentation.

## The Final Pre-Launch Service

The last Pre-Launch Service, held the week before Launch Sunday, is special:

### Make It Count

This is your final full rehearsal. Treat it like Launch Sunday as much as possible. No stopping, no do-overs. Run it straight through.

### Celebrate

After the service and debrief, take time to celebrate:
- Acknowledge the hard work
- Express gratitude to each team
- Share excitement for what's coming
- Pray together with anticipation

### Rest

Send everyone home with instructions to rest. The week ahead will be intense. They've prepared well—now it's time to trust God and be refreshed.

Pre-Launch Services are where preparation meets practice. Each one builds confidence, competence, and unity. By the time Launch Sunday arrives, your team will be ready—not because everything is perfect, but because they've worked through problems together and trusted God with the outcome.
