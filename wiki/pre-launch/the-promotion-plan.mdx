*/}

Three to four weeks before Launch Sunday triggers the full launch of your promotion plan. This is when you get the word out to as many people as possible using every channel available.

Promotion isn't about hype or marketing tricks. It's about ensuring that people who need what your church offers actually know you exist.

## The Goal of Promotion

Effective promotion accomplishes one primary goal: **awareness that leads to attendance**.

You want people to:
1. Know your church exists
2. Know when and where you meet
3. Feel invited and welcome to attend
4. Remember you when they're ready to try church

<Callout type="insight">
  Most people need to encounter a message 7+ times before they act on it. 
  Multi-channel promotion increases the likelihood that your church breaks 
  through the noise of daily life.

## Developing Your Promotion Plan

### Start with Your Budget

Be realistic about what you can afford. Effective promotion doesn't require a massive budget, but it does require intentional allocation of resources.

| Budget Level | Recommended Focus |
|--------------|-------------------|
| **Minimal** | Personal invitations, social media, yard signs |
| **Moderate** | Add door hangers, invitation cards, local ads |
| **Substantial** | Add direct mail, radio, billboards |

### Prioritize High-Impact Channels

Not all promotion is equal. Some channels consistently outperform others:

**Highest Impact:**
- Personal invitations from Launch Team members
- Social media (targeted, organic, and paid)
- Door hangers in target neighborhoods

**Moderate Impact:**
- Direct mail postcards
- Local newspaper/media coverage
- Partner church announcements

**Variable Impact:**
- Radio advertising
- Billboard advertising
- Online advertising

<Callout type="warning">
  The most effective promotion is always personal invitation. No amount of 
  advertising can substitute for a genuine invitation from someone who cares.

## Personal Invitation Strategy

Personal invitations are your most powerful promotional tool. Every Launch Team member should be actively inviting.

### Set Clear Goals

Challenge each Launch Team member to:
- Identify 10-15 people to personally invite
- Have face-to-face or phone conversations (not just texts)
- Follow up with those who express interest
- Bring at least one person or family to Launch Sunday

### Equip with Tools

Provide Launch Team members with:
- Invitation cards to hand out
- Key information (time, location, what to expect)
- Answers to common questions
- Permission to be enthusiastic

### Track and Encourage

Check in weekly on invitation progress:
- How many conversations have you had?
- What responses are you getting?
- How can we pray for your contacts?

## Promotional Materials

### Essential Items

| Item | Purpose | Quantity |
|------|---------|----------|
| Invitation cards | Personal handouts | 500-1000 |
| Door hangers | Neighborhood saturation | Based on target area |
| Yard signs | Visibility in community | 25-50 |
| Social media graphics | Online presence | Multiple sizes/versions |
| Website | Information hub | 1, optimized |

### Optional Items

| Item | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| Direct mail postcards | Budget allows, target area defined |
| Video content | Strong videography capability |
| Radio ads | Budget allows, target demographic matches |
| Billboard | High-traffic location available |

### Design Principles

All promotional materials should:

- Clearly communicate time and location
- Include website and/or QR code for more information
- Feel welcoming and professional
- Avoid insider language

---

## Digital Promotion

### Website

Your website is your digital front door. Ensure it:
- Loads quickly on mobile devices
- Clearly states when and where you meet
- Explains what to expect for first-time guests
- Provides easy contact information
- Has a clear path to learn more

### Social Media

Focus your energy where your target audience spends time:

| Platform | Best For |
|----------|----------|
| Facebook | Families, community events, groups |
| Instagram | Visual content, younger audiences |
| YouTube | Video content, sermon previews |

**Content ideas:**
- Behind-the-scenes preparation
- Team member testimonials
- Countdown posts
- Event information
- Community engagement

### Paid Advertising

If budget allows, consider:
- Facebook/Instagram ads targeted to your geographic area
- Google Ads for relevant search terms
- Boosted posts for high-performing organic content

<Callout type="tip">
  Start with a small paid advertising budget to test what works. Scale up 
  spending on ads that perform well, and cut what doesn't.
</Callout>

## Community Outreach

### Local Media

Send a press release to local newspapers and news stations. "New Church Launches" can be legitimate local news, especially in smaller communities.

Include:
- Who: Church name, Senior Pastor name
- What: Church launch
- When: Launch Sunday date and time
- Where: Location
- Why: Brief vision statement
- Contact information for follow-up

### Community Presence

Look for opportunities to be visibly present in the community:
- Community events and festivals
- Service projects
- Local business partnerships
- Neighborhood gatherings

---

## Partner Church Support

Your network of partner churches can amplify your launch:

### Announcements

The week before Launch Sunday, provide partner churches with:
- A PowerPoint slide (Senior Pastor photo, church name, launch date)
- Brief announcement copy for their bulletin or screen
- Website information to share

### Prayer

Ask partner churches to pray for your launch in their services. This builds connection and spiritual covering.

### Referrals

Partner churches may have members who live in your area. Ask if they'll share information with those who might benefit from a church closer to home.

---

## Measuring Effectiveness

Track what you can to learn for the future:

| Metric | How to Track |
|--------|--------------|
| Personal invitations made | Launch Team self-reporting |
| Social media reach | Platform analytics |
| Website visits | Google Analytics |
| "How did you hear about us?" | Connection card question |

The most important metric is the last one. Ask every Launch Sunday guest how they heard about you. This data shapes future promotion strategy.

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Starting too late** — Promotion needs lead time. Don't wait until the last week.
2. **Relying only on advertising** — Advertising supports personal invitation; it doesn't replace it.
3. **Inconsistent messaging** — All materials should tell the same story with the same details.
4. **Ignoring digital** — Most people will check your website before visiting. Make it count.
5. **Underspending on printing** — Running out of invitation cards is a missed opportunity.

Promotion isn't about self-aggrandizement—it's about ensuring that people who need the gospel and the community of faith actually hear about the opportunity you're creating. Go and tell them.
