## Personal Invitation

**Impact Level:** Highest

Personal invitation remains the most effective way to get people to attend church. Studies consistently show that the majority of first-time church visitors come because someone they know invited them.

### Why It Works

- Trust is already established
- Questions can be answered in real-time
- The invitation feels personal, not mass-marketed
- Someone will be there to welcome them

### Best Practices

- Invite people you genuinely care about
- Be specific: "Would you come with me to our church launch on September 8?"
- Offer to meet them there or pick them up
- Follow up if they express interest
- Don't be discouraged by "no"—the seed is planted

### Resources Needed

- Invitation cards for each Launch Team member
- Key talking points for common questions
- Encouragement and accountability from leadership

<Callout type="tip">
  Role-play invitation conversations with your Launch Team. Many people want 
  to invite but feel awkward. Practice reduces anxiety and increases follow-through.

## Social Media

**Impact Level:** High

Social media offers free or low-cost access to your target community with the ability to target specific demographics and geographic areas.

### Facebook

**Best for:** Families, community events, local groups

| Content Type | Purpose |

| Event page | Central hub for launch information |
| Countdown posts | Build anticipation |
| Behind-the-scenes | Show personality and authenticity |
| Team introductions | Help people feel they'll know someone |
| Paid ads | Expand reach to targeted audiences |

**Posting frequency:** Daily in final two weeks

### Instagram

**Best for:** Visual storytelling, younger demographics

| Content Type | Purpose |
|--------------|---------|
| Stories | Daily updates, behind-the-scenes |
| Reels | Short, engaging video content |
| Posts | Polished images with key information |
| Countdown sticker | Interactive engagement |

**Posting frequency:** 1-2 posts daily, multiple stories

### Tips for All Platforms

- Use high-quality images and graphics
- Maintain consistent branding across all posts
- Engage with comments and messages promptly
- Include clear calls to action
- Use relevant local hashtags

## Invitation Cards

**Impact Level:** High

Physical invitation cards give Launch Team members something tangible to hand out during conversations.

### Design Elements

- Church name and logo
- Launch Sunday date and time
- Location with address
- Website and/or QR code
- Brief tagline or invitation

### Specifications

- Size: Business card or postcard size
- Paper: Quality cardstock
- Quantity: 50-100 per Launch Team member
- Finish: Glossy or matte (professional appearance)

### Distribution

- Every Launch Team member carries a supply
- Available at Vision Meetings
- Placed in community locations (with permission)
- Included with door hangers

---

## Door Hangers

**Impact Level:** Moderate to High

Door hangers allow you to saturate specific neighborhoods with your launch message.

### Design Elements

- Eye-catching design (it competes with other door hangers)
- Church name and clear branding
- Launch Sunday date, time, location
- QR code linking to website
- Brief, compelling message

### Distribution Strategy

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| Launch Team | Free, builds ownership | Time-intensive |
| Paid service | Fast, professional | Cost |
| Hybrid | Best of both | Coordination needed |

### Targeting

Focus on neighborhoods within 10-15 minutes of your worship location:
- Family-oriented neighborhoods
- New housing developments
- Areas without nearby church options

### Timing

Distribute 2-3 weeks before launch. Too early and people forget; too late and they've made other plans.

<Callout type="warning">
  Check local regulations before distributing. Some areas have restrictions 
  on unsolicited materials. Respect "No Soliciting" signs.
</Callout>

## Yard Signs

**Impact Level:** Moderate

Yard signs create visibility in the community and show that real people support your church.

### Design Elements

- Simple, readable from a moving car
- Church name prominently displayed
- Launch date
- Website URL (short and memorable)
- High-contrast colors

### Placement Strategy

- Launch Team member yards
- Busy intersections (with permission)
- Near your worship location
- Along major commuting routes

### Quantity

25-50 signs typically provides good coverage without excessive cost.

### Timing

Place 2-3 weeks before launch. Remove promptly after Launch Sunday.

---

## Direct Mail

**Impact Level:** Moderate

Direct mail postcards can reach every household in a defined geographic area.

### Design Elements

- Oversized postcard (stands out from regular mail)
- Compelling headline
- High-quality images
- Clear date, time, location
- Website and contact information

### Targeting

Work with a mailing service to target:
- Specific zip codes
- Radius around your location
- New movers to the area
- Demographic characteristics

### Timing

Mail to arrive 2 weeks before launch. Consider a second wave the week before.

### Cost Considerations

Direct mail is expensive compared to other channels. Calculate cost per piece (design + printing + postage) and determine if the reach justifies the investment.

---

## Local Media

**Impact Level:** Variable (can be high if picked up)

Local newspapers, news websites, and TV stations sometimes cover church launches as community news.

### Press Release Elements

- Compelling headline
- Who, what, when, where, why
- Quote from Senior Pastor
- Background on the church/network
- High-resolution photo
- Contact information for follow-up

### Submission Strategy

- Send to religion/community editors
- Submit 2-3 weeks before launch
- Follow up with a phone call
- Offer an interview or photo opportunity

### Managing Expectations

Media coverage isn't guaranteed. View it as a bonus rather than a primary strategy.

---

## Radio Advertising

**Impact Level:** Variable

Radio can reach a broad audience but works best when listeners hear your message multiple times.

### Considerations

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Station selection | Must match your target demographic |
| Frequency | Requires multiple plays to be effective |
| Timing | Drive time slots are expensive but effective |
| Cost | Can be significant for adequate frequency |

### Script Elements

- Clear church name (spelled out if necessary)
- Launch date and time
- Location (simple directions)
- Website for more information
- Warm, inviting tone

### When to Use

Radio works best when:
- You have budget for adequate frequency
- A station matches your demographic
- Other promotion channels are already in place

---

## Billboard Advertising

**Impact Level:** Variable

Billboards offer high visibility but limited message space.

### Design Principles

- 7 words or fewer (people are driving)
- Large, readable font
- Simple, striking image
- Church name and launch date
- Website URL

### Location Strategy

- Near your worship location
- Major commuting routes
- High-traffic intersections

### Cost Considerations

Billboard costs vary dramatically by location and demand. High-traffic locations may be prohibitively expensive for a church plant budget.

---

## Partner Church Announcements

**Impact Level:** Moderate

Your network of partner churches can announce your launch to their congregations.

### What to Provide

- PowerPoint slide with Senior Pastor photo
- Brief announcement script
- Bulletin insert (optional)
- Website information

### Timing

Request announcements for the Sunday before Launch Sunday.

### Follow-Up

Thank partner churches for their support. Share Launch Sunday results with them.

---

## Video Content

**Impact Level:** Moderate to High

Video brings your church to life in ways static images cannot.

### Types of Video

| Type | Purpose | Length |
|------|---------|--------|
| Invitation video | Share on social media | 60-90 seconds |
| Pastor intro | Let people meet the Senior Pastor | 2-3 minutes |
| Team testimonials | Show real people | 30-60 seconds each |
| Behind-the-scenes | Build connection | 1-2 minutes |

### Quality Considerations

- Good audio matters more than perfect video
- Natural lighting works well
- Steady shots (use a tripod)
- Keep it authentic over polished

### Distribution

- Social media (native upload performs better)
- Website
- Email to contacts
- Partner churches

<Callout type="tip">
  You don't need professional equipment. Modern smartphones shoot excellent 
  video. Focus on good lighting, clear audio, and authentic content.
</Callout>

---

## Email Marketing

**Impact Level:** Moderate (to those who've opted in)

Email reaches people who've already expressed interest through Vision Meetings or website sign-ups.

### Content Ideas

- Launch countdown updates
- What to expect on Launch Sunday
- Pastor's personal invitation
- Prayer requests
- Logistical information

### Best Practices

- Send weekly in the month before launch
- Keep emails concise and mobile-friendly
- Include clear call to action
- Respect unsubscribes

Every channel is an opportunity to extend an invitation. Use the ones that make sense for your context, budget, and community. The goal is simple: help people find their way to a church where they can encounter Jesus.
