*/}

The week before Launch Sunday, gather your ministry team leaders for a final checklist review. This isn't the time for new initiatives—it's the time to confirm that everything is in place and everyone knows their role.

This review brings peace of mind. When you've systematically confirmed every detail, you can approach Launch Sunday with confidence rather than anxiety.

---

## When to Conduct the Review

Schedule your final checklist review **5-7 days before Launch Sunday**. This timing gives you:

- Enough runway to address any gaps discovered
- Fresh information that won't become outdated
- Time to communicate any changes to team members

### Who Should Participate

- Senior Pastor
- Launch Coordinator
- All ministry team leaders
- Anyone responsible for critical launch functions

---

## How to Use This Checklist

Work through each section with the responsible leader. Don't just check boxes—have a brief conversation to confirm understanding and readiness.

| Response | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| ✓ Ready | This item is complete and confirmed |
| ⚠ In Progress | Being addressed, will be ready by launch |
| ✗ Needs Attention | Requires immediate action |

Flag any "Needs Attention" items for follow-up before Launch Sunday.
