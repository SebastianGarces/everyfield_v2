Planting a church is a high calling. It requires **much faith**, **much work**, and **much perseverance**. It is a supernatural work of Jesus building His church (Matt. 16:18), and we have the tremendous privilege of partnering with Him in this work.

This playbook is your guide to that partnership.

## What is the Launch Playbook?

The Launch Playbook is a record of current best practices in church planting. It's a living document—refined through experience, shaped by predecessors, and designed to help you avoid common mistakes while maximizing your effectiveness.

This isn't theory. It's practical wisdom from church planters who have walked this path before you.

## Three Goals for Using This Playbook

### 1. Learn from Predecessors

Become a more effective church planter by learning from those who came before you. Their successes and failures are captured here so you don't have to discover everything through trial and error.

<Callout type="insight">
  Every best practice in this playbook was learned through real experience—often
  through costly mistakes. You get to benefit from that learning without paying
  the same price.
</Callout>

### 2. Customize Your Approach

Use this playbook as a catalyst for developing your own approach. Your circumstances, community, and calling are unique. Take what works, adapt what needs adjusting, and build something tailored to your context.

The principles are universal. The application is personal.

### 3. Contribute Back

Your experience will add to the collective wisdom. As you plant, you'll discover things that work in your context, encounter challenges others haven't faced, and develop solutions worth sharing.

Future church planters will benefit from your journey just as you benefit from those before you.

## How to Navigate the Playbook

The Launch Playbook is organized into phases that follow the natural progression of a church plant:

| Phase | Focus | Key Activities |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| **Phase 1** | Vision & Core Group | Vision Meetings, building the Core Group, formalizing commitment |
| **Phase 2** | Launch Team & Training | Setting launch date, training, establishing leadership roles |
| **Phase 3** | Pre-Launch & Launch | Final preparations, promotion, Launch Sunday execution |
| **Phase 4** | Administrative | Legal setup, finances, equipment, technology |

You don't need to read everything at once. Focus on the phase you're in, but occasionally look ahead to prepare for what's coming.

## A Word Before You Begin

Church planting is not a formula. It's a faith journey that requires dependence on God at every step. This playbook provides structure and guidance, but it cannot replace:

- **Prayer** — Constant, fervent communication with God
- **The Holy Spirit's leading** — Sensitivity to His direction in your specific context
- **Faith** — Believing God for what only He can accomplish
- **Perseverance** — Enduring through difficulties that will certainly come

Use this playbook as a tool, not a substitute for spiritual vitality.

<Callout type="important">
  The playbook equips you with best practices, but only God builds the church.
  Stay dependent on Him throughout the process.
</Callout>
