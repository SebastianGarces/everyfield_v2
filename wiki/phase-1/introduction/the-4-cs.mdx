# The 4 C's: Committed, Compelled, Contagious, Courageous

Not everyone who expresses interest in your church plant should join your Core Group. Church planting is too demanding, too costly, and too important to fill your team with people who aren't fully ready.

The 4 C's define the character and commitment required. Every Core Group member must be **COMMITTED**, **COMPELLED**, **CONTAGIOUS**, and **COURAGEOUS**.

---

## Why the 4 C's Matter

Church planting is hard. You'll face:
- Financial pressure
- Spiritual opposition
- Relational conflict
- Exhaustion and discouragement
- Setbacks and disappointments

A Core Group filled with the right people will endure these challenges and emerge stronger. A Core Group with the wrong people will fracture under pressure, creating division and discouragement at the worst possible time.

<Callout type="important">
  The 4 C's aren't optional nice-to-haves. They're essential requirements. Be
  willing to grow slowly with the right people rather than quickly with the
  wrong ones.
</Callout>

## The 4 C's Explained

### 1. COMMITTED

**Fully dedicated to the vision, mission, and distinctives of the church plant.**

Commitment means more than casual interest. It means:

| Surface Interest | True Commitment |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| "This sounds interesting" | "I'm all in" |
| "I'll come when I can" | "This is my priority" |
| "I hope it works out" | "I'll sacrifice to make it work" |
| "Let me know if you need help" | "What do you need me to do?" |

**Signs of commitment:**
- Regular attendance at Vision Meetings and Core Group gatherings
- Willingness to rearrange schedules for church plant activities
- Financial giving that demonstrates sacrifice
- Following through on commitments and responsibilities

**Red flags:**
- Chronic absence or last-minute cancellations
- Unwillingness to adjust personal priorities
- Excuses for why they can't contribute
- Enthusiasm without follow-through

<Callout type="tip">
  Commitment is revealed over time. Don't rush people into the Core Group.
  Watch for consistent patterns of dedication before formalizing their role.
</Callout>

### 2. COMPELLED

**Driven by conviction to participate in this specific church plant.**

Compelled people don't need to be convinced—they feel an internal drive to be part of what God is doing. This isn't obligation or guilt; it's genuine passion.

**Signs of being compelled:**
- They articulate why this church plant matters to them personally
- They initiate conversations about the vision with others
- They bring ideas and energy, not just attendance
- They feel genuine excitement about the future

**Questions that reveal compulsion:**
- "Why do you want to be part of this?"
- "What excites you most about this church plant?"
- "How does this connect to what God is doing in your life?"

People who are truly compelled have answers that come from the heart, not rehearsed responses.

---

### 3. CONTAGIOUS

**Enthusiasm that spreads to others.**

Contagious people don't just hold the vision—they spread it. Their excitement is infectious. When they talk about the church plant, others want to know more.

**Characteristics of contagious people:**
- Natural evangelists for the vision
- Invite others to Vision Meetings without being asked
- Speak positively about the church plant in everyday conversations
- Their networks become aware of the church plant through organic sharing

<Callout type="insight">
  Contagious Core Group members are your best recruiting tool. One truly
  contagious person can bring more guests to Vision Meetings than all your
  marketing efforts combined.
</Callout>

**How to identify contagious people:**
- Who brought guests to the last Vision Meeting?
- Who talks about the church plant on social media?
- Who introduces you to their friends and family?
- Who asks for invitation cards to distribute?

If someone is excited but never shares that excitement with others, they may be committed but not contagious.

---

### 4. COURAGEOUS

**Willing to take risks and step out in faith.**

Church planting requires courage. The Core Group must be willing to:

- Leave comfortable church situations
- Invest time and money with uncertain outcomes
- Face opposition and criticism
- Persevere when things get difficult
- Try new things that might fail

**Signs of courage:**
- Willingness to have hard conversations
- Stepping up for difficult responsibilities
- Maintaining commitment during setbacks
- Speaking up when something needs to be said
- Taking initiative rather than waiting to be told

**Signs of insufficient courage:**
- Waiting to see if the plant will succeed before fully committing
- Hedging bets by maintaining backup options
- Avoiding any responsibility that involves risk
- Shrinking back when challenged or criticized

<Callout type="warning">
  Courageous doesn't mean reckless. Look for people who count the cost and still
  say yes—not people who blindly agree without understanding the sacrifice.
</Callout>

## Evaluating Potential Core Group Members

When someone expresses interest in joining the Core Group, evaluate them against all 4 C's:

| Quality | Questions to Consider |
|---------|----------------------|
| **Committed** | Are they consistently showing up? Following through? Prioritizing the plant? |
| **Compelled** | Do they have genuine internal motivation? Can they articulate why this matters to them? |
| **Contagious** | Are they spreading the vision? Bringing guests? Talking about the plant? |
| **Courageous** | Are they willing to sacrifice? Take risks? Persevere through difficulty? |

### The Interview Process

Before formalizing someone's place in the Core Group, have a direct conversation:

1. **Share expectations clearly** — Make sure they understand what's required
2. **Ask probing questions** — Don't accept surface answers
3. **Look for evidence** — Past behavior predicts future behavior
4. **Give them an out** — Make it easy to say no if they're not ready

It's better to have an awkward conversation now than a dysfunctional team member later.

## What If Someone Lacks One of the 4 C's?

Not everyone starts with all 4 C's fully developed. Consider:

| Situation | Approach |
|-----------|----------|
| **Missing one quality** | Coach them specifically in that area; revisit in 60-90 days |
| **Missing two qualities** | They're not ready; maintain relationship but don't include in Core Group |
| **Strong in all four** | Welcome them enthusiastically to the Core Group |

Some people can be developed. Others aren't ready for this particular role at this particular time. Discernment is required.

<Callout type="tip">
  When in doubt, wait. It's easier to add someone to the Core Group later than
  to remove them after they've joined.
</Callout>
