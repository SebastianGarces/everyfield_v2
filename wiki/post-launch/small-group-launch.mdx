Sunday services create crowds. **Small groups create community.** A church without healthy small groups will struggle to disciple people deeply, care for people personally, and develop leaders effectively.

Your small group ministry should be fully ready by Launch Sunday—leaders trained, groups formed, curriculum selected. Now it's time to launch those groups and build momentum for ongoing growth.

## Why Small Groups Matter

Small groups accomplish what Sunday services cannot:

| Sunday Service | Small Group |
|----------------|-------------|
| One-to-many communication | Many-to-many conversation |
| Anonymous attendance possible | Personal connection expected |
| Consumes content | Processes and applies content |
| Observes community | Experiences community |
| Receives care generally | Receives care specifically |

<Callout type="insight">
  The early church met in homes (Acts 2:46). Small groups aren't a modern 
  invention—they're a return to the biblical pattern of Christian community.
</Callout>

## Pre-Launch Preparation Review

Before your first groups meet, confirm these elements are in place:

### Leaders Are Trained

Every small group leader should have completed:

- Small Group 101 training
- Understanding of your church's values and DNA
- Practical skills for facilitating discussion
- Clear expectations for their role

[Learn more about Small Group 101](/wiki/training/small-group-101)

### Groups Are Formed

Initial groups should be established based on:

- Geography (meeting location accessibility)
- Life stage (singles, young families, empty nesters, etc.)
- Affinity (when appropriate)
- Leader capacity and fit

### Curriculum Is Selected

Have curriculum ready for at least the first 8-12 weeks. Consider:

- Sermon-based discussion guides
- Published small group curriculum
- Book studies
- Custom content aligned with your church's focus

### Logistics Are Clear

Each group needs:

- Meeting location confirmed
- Meeting time and frequency established
- Communication method set up (group text, email list, etc.)
- Childcare plan (if applicable)

## The Launch Timeline

### Week 1-2: Soft Launch

Start groups with your Launch Team members first. They've been trained, they understand the vision, and they provide feedback to refine the process.

**Goals:**
- Test the curriculum and format
- Build leader confidence
- Work out logistics issues
- Create momentum and testimonies

### Week 3-4: Promotion Push

Begin inviting new attendees to join groups.

**Promotion methods:**
- Sunday announcements (brief, compelling)
- Connection card checkbox
- Personal invitation from congregation
- Website and social media promotion
- Guest reception mentions

### Week 5-8: Connection Emphasis

Make small group connection a primary emphasis in your assimilation process.

**Actions:**
- Follow up with guests about group interest
- Connect Party with the Pastor attendees to groups
- Train congregation to invite people to their groups
- Track connection rates and follow up with unconnected

---

## Connecting People to Groups

The biggest challenge isn't launching groups—it's getting people into them. Be intentional about connection.

### Make It Easy

Remove barriers to joining:

- Provide a simple sign-up process (card, website, app)
- Offer multiple group options (times, locations, types)
- Allow people to "try" a group before committing
- Provide childcare information upfront

### Make It Personal

Personal invitation is far more effective than announcements:

- Train your congregation to invite their contacts
- Have leaders reach out to potential members
- Connect people based on relationships, not just demographics

### Make It Urgent

Create natural on-ramps with defined start dates:

- "Groups launch September 10"
- "New group semester begins in January"
- "Join a group for our 6-week series"

<Callout type="tip">
  Open enrollment periods work better than perpetual availability. When groups 
  have a clear start date, people are more likely to commit.

## Supporting Your Leaders

Small group success depends on leader health. Your Small Group Leader or Small Group Director must prioritize leader support.

### Regular Leader Meetings

Meet with all small group leaders monthly (at minimum) for:

- Encouragement and vision casting
- Troubleshooting and Q&A
- Training on specific skills
- Prayer and fellowship

### Coaching Structure

As groups multiply, implement a coaching structure:

- Each coach oversees 3-5 group leaders
- Coaches meet with leaders regularly
- Coaches report to the Small Group Director

### Resource Provision

Provide leaders with what they need:

- Curriculum and discussion guides
- Training materials
- Connection to the Senior Pastor's vision
- Appreciation and recognition

---

## The Apprentice Model

Healthy groups multiply. Build multiplication into your DNA from the beginning through the apprentice model.

### Every Group Has an Apprentice

Challenge every leader to identify and develop an apprentice—someone who will eventually lead their own group.

### Apprentice Development Process

1. **Identify** — Leader identifies someone with leadership potential
2. **Invite** — Leader invites them to consider the apprentice role
3. **Involve** — Apprentice begins participating in leadership tasks
4. **Increase** — Apprentice takes on more responsibility over time
5. **Invest** — Leader mentors apprentice in leadership skills
6. **Launch** — Apprentice launches their own group

### Multiplication Timeline

Set expectations for multiplication:

- Most groups should multiply within 12-18 months
- Multiplication happens through launching the apprentice
- The original leader may keep their group or launch a new one

<Callout type="important">
  Without multiplication built into your DNA, groups become closed cliques 
  instead of growing communities. The apprentice model prevents stagnation.
</Callout>

## Tracking Group Health

Not all groups are equally healthy. Monitor group health through regular assessment.

### Health Indicators

Healthy groups demonstrate:

- Consistent attendance
- New people joining over time
- Authentic community and vulnerability
- Application of Scripture to life
- Outward focus (serving, inviting)
- Developing leaders (apprentice in place)

### Warning Signs

Watch for groups that:

- Have declining or stagnant attendance
- Never add new members
- Have the same people talking every week
- Avoid conflict or hard topics
- Have leader burnout or frustration
- Have no apprentice after 6+ months

### Regular Check-ins

Use monthly leader meetings and periodic surveys to assess group health. Address issues early before they become entrenched.

## Handling Group Challenges

Common challenges and how to address them:

### Low Attendance

- Check if the time/location works for members
- Encourage personal invitation
- Evaluate if the curriculum is engaging
- Consider merging with another group

### Group Conflict

- Coach the leader on conflict resolution
- Meet with involved parties if needed
- Remember that some conflict is healthy growth

### Leader Burnout

- Ensure leader has adequate support
- Encourage sabbaticals with apprentice covering
- Evaluate if the leader needs to step down or take a break

### Group Stagnation

- Challenge the group to add new members
- Encourage the launch of an apprentice
- Consider intentional multiplication

## Long-Term Vision

In the first year, focus on:

1. **Launching** groups with your trained leaders
2. **Connecting** as many people as possible to groups
3. **Supporting** leaders well
4. **Developing** apprentices in every group

As you grow, expand to:

- Multiple group types (men's, women's, couples, etc.)
- Specialized groups (recovery, parenting, etc.)
- Short-term groups (sermon series, book studies)
- Robust coaching structure
- Leader pipeline development

The early church gathered in homes. Your small groups carry on that legacy—creating space for genuine community, mutual care, and spiritual growth.
