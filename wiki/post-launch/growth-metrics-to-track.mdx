What gets measured gets managed. In the months following your launch, tracking the right metrics helps you understand what's working, identify problems early, and make informed decisions about where to invest your energy.

But not all metrics are equally important. **Vanity metrics** make you feel good but don't drive decisions. **Health metrics** reveal the true condition of your church and guide your leadership.

## The Danger of Wrong Metrics

It's tempting to focus solely on attendance—after all, it's easy to count and feels significant. But attendance alone doesn't tell you if people are being discipled, if guests are returning, or if your church is healthy.

A church can have growing attendance and declining health. A church can have stable attendance and thriving discipleship. The metrics you choose shape what you see and how you lead.

<Callout type="warning">
  Don't become a slave to metrics. Numbers measure activity, not necessarily 
  spiritual health. Use metrics as tools for insight, not gods to serve.
</Callout>

## Categories of Metrics

Track metrics across these key categories:

1. **Attendance & Growth** — Are people showing up?
2. **Guest Assimilation** — Are newcomers connecting?
3. **Discipleship & Community** — Are people growing?
4. **Serving & Leadership** — Are people contributing?
5. **Financial Health** — Is the church sustainable?

## Attendance & Growth Metrics

### Weekly Attendance

Track total attendance every week, broken down by:

- Adult worship attendance
- Children's ministry attendance
- Total attendance

**Why it matters:** Shows overall growth or decline trends.

**What to watch:** Look for patterns over months, not weeks. Single weeks fluctuate; trends reveal truth.

### Average Attendance

Calculate rolling average (typically 4-week or monthly) to smooth out fluctuations.

| Month | Weekly Avg | % Change |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| Month 1 | 85 | — |
| Month 2 | 92 | +8.2% |
| Month 3 | 88 | -4.3% |
| Month 4 | 101 | +14.8% |

**Why it matters:** More accurate picture than individual weeks.

### First-Time Guests

Count first-time guests each week.

**Why it matters:** Indicates community awareness and invitation effectiveness.

**What to watch:** If guest flow stops, your church may be becoming inwardly focused.

---

## Guest Assimilation Metrics

### Return Rate

Percentage of first-time guests who return within 30 days.

**Formula:** (Returning guests ÷ First-time guests) × 100

**Healthy benchmark:** 25-40% return rate

**Why it matters:** Low return rate indicates problems with the guest experience or follow-up.

### Follow-Up Rate

Percentage of guests contacted within 48 hours.

**Target:** 100%

**Why it matters:** Follow-up directly correlates with return rate.

### Membership Conversion

Percentage of regular attenders who complete membership.

**Why it matters:** Indicates commitment level and assimilation process effectiveness.

<Callout type="tip">
  Track the full journey: Guest → Return Guest → Regular Attender → Member. 
  Identify where people drop off and focus improvement there.

## Discipleship & Community Metrics

### Small Group Participation

Percentage of adult attenders connected to a small group.

**Healthy benchmark:** 50-70% of regular attenders

**Formula:** (Small group participants ÷ Average adult attendance) × 100

**Why it matters:** Small groups are your primary discipleship engine. Low participation means people aren't growing in community.

### Group Growth

Number of small groups and total participants over time.

| Quarter | Groups | Participants | Avg Size |
|---------|--------|--------------|----------|
| Q1 | 6 | 42 | 7 |
| Q2 | 7 | 54 | 7.7 |
| Q3 | 8 | 61 | 7.6 |
| Q4 | 10 | 78 | 7.8 |

**Why it matters:** Shows whether your group ministry is multiplying or stagnating.

### Baptisms

Number of baptisms over time.

**Why it matters:** Baptism indicates new believers and spiritual fruit.

### Membership Class Completion

Number of people completing Peak Performance or equivalent.

**Why it matters:** Shows movement toward commitment and engagement.

---

## Serving & Leadership Metrics

### Volunteer Participation

Percentage of regular attenders serving in a ministry role.

**Healthy benchmark:** 30-50% of regular attenders

**Formula:** (Active volunteers ÷ Average adult attendance) × 100

**Why it matters:** High volunteer participation indicates ownership and engagement. Low participation means people are consumers, not contributors.

### Volunteer Retention

Percentage of volunteers still serving after 6 months or 1 year.

**Why it matters:** Constant volunteer turnover exhausts leaders and reduces quality.

### Leadership Pipeline

Number of people in leadership development processes (apprentices, Boot Camp, etc.).

**Why it matters:** Future health depends on developing new leaders.

<Callout type="insight">
  A church that isn't developing leaders is a church that will plateau. Track 
  your leadership pipeline as carefully as your attendance.
</Callout>

## Financial Health Metrics

### Weekly Giving

Total giving each week.

**Track both:**
- Total amount
- Number of giving units (households/individuals giving)

### Giving Per Capita

Average giving per attending adult.

**Formula:** Total giving ÷ Average adult attendance

**Why it matters:** Shows generosity depth, not just total amount.

### Budget vs. Actual

Monthly comparison of budgeted income/expenses vs. actual.

**Why it matters:** Early identification of shortfalls or overruns.

### Reserves

Months of operating expenses held in reserve.

**Healthy benchmark:** 2-3 months minimum

### Self-Sustainability Ratio

Percentage of operating budget funded by congregational giving (vs. external support).

**Formula:** (Congregational giving ÷ Total income) × 100

**Why it matters:** Shows progress toward financial independence.

## How to Track Metrics

### Weekly Tracking

Every Sunday, capture:

- Attendance (total, adults, kids)
- First-time guests
- Connection cards submitted
- Giving total

### Monthly Review

Each month, calculate:

- Average attendance for the month
- Guest return rate
- Follow-up completion rate
- Giving per capita
- Budget vs. actual
- Volunteer count updates

### Quarterly Analysis

Each quarter, assess:

- Trends across all metric categories
- Small group participation rate
- Membership conversion rate
- Volunteer participation rate
- Progress toward goals

### Annual Evaluation

Annually, conduct a comprehensive review:

- Year-over-year comparisons for all metrics
- Goal setting for the next year
- Strategic adjustments based on data

## Creating a Dashboard

Compile your key metrics into a simple dashboard that you review regularly.

**Sample Weekly Dashboard:**

| Metric | This Week | Last Week | 4-Week Avg |
|--------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Total Attendance | 94 | 88 | 91 |
| First-Time Guests | 6 | 4 | 5 |
| Connection Cards | 8 | 5 | 6 |
| Weekly Giving | $4,250 | $3,800 | $4,100 |

**Sample Monthly Dashboard:**

| Metric | This Month | Last Month | Target |
|--------|------------|------------|--------|
| Avg Attendance | 91 | 86 | 100 |
| Guest Return Rate | 32% | 28% | 35% |
| Follow-Up Rate | 95% | 88% | 100% |
| Small Group % | 48% | 45% | 60% |
| Volunteer % | 35% | 33% | 40% |
| Budget vs Actual | +2% | -5% | 0% |

## Using Metrics Wisely

### Celebrate Wins

When metrics improve, celebrate with your team. Recognition motivates continued effort.

### Investigate Declines

When metrics decline, investigate before reacting. One bad week isn't a crisis. A three-month trend deserves attention.

### Make Decisions

Use metrics to inform decisions:

- Low guest count? → Increase invitation emphasis
- Low return rate? → Improve guest experience and follow-up
- Low group participation? → Launch connection emphasis
- Low volunteer percentage? → Cast vision for serving

### Don't Obsess

Metrics are servants, not masters. Don't check numbers daily or let fluctuations control your emotions. Review on a healthy rhythm and focus on leading people, not managing numbers.

Growth is ultimately God's work. Track what you can measure, steward what you can control, and trust the Lord to build His church.
