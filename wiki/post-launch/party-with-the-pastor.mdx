**Party with the Pastor** is a key touchpoint in your assimilation pathway. It's an informal gathering—typically in the pastor's home—where guests and newer attendees can connect personally with the Senior Pastor, hear the vision of the church, and take their next step toward commitment.

This isn't a formal meeting. It's a party. The atmosphere is relaxed, the conversation is genuine, and the goal is relationship.

## Purpose of Party with the Pastor

Party with the Pastor accomplishes several important goals:

1. **Personal connection** — Guests meet the pastor as a real person, not just a preacher
2. **Vision casting** — The pastor shares the heart and vision of the church in a personal setting
3. **Question answering** — Guests can ask questions they might not ask in a larger setting
4. **Community building** — Guests meet others who are also exploring the church
5. **Next step clarification** — Guests learn about membership, small groups, and serving

  People follow leaders they trust. Party with the Pastor builds trust by 
  creating personal access to the Senior Pastor in a comfortable environment.

## Who Should Attend?

Invite people who have:

- Visited 2-3 times or more
- Expressed interest in learning more about the church
- Completed a connection card indicating interest
- Been personally identified as engaged guests

Party with the Pastor is not typically for first-time guests. It's for people who have shown enough interest to warrant a deeper conversation.

## Frequency and Timing

### How Often?

In the early months post-launch, host Party with the Pastor monthly. As your church grows, you may shift to:

- Monthly (ideal for smaller churches)
- Bi-monthly
- Quarterly (for larger churches with other connection pathways)

### When?

Sunday afternoon or evening works well for most people. The gathering flows naturally from the morning service experience.

**Sample timing:**
- Sunday at 5:00 PM
- 2-hour duration (5:00 - 7:00 PM)

---

## Location

### The Pastor's Home (Preferred)

Hosting in the pastor's home is ideal because it:

- Creates a warm, personal atmosphere
- Demonstrates hospitality and openness
- Removes the "church building" formality
- Makes the pastor approachable

### Alternatives

If the pastor's home isn't suitable:

- A church member's home
- A casual restaurant private room
- A comfortable space at your facility

The key is warmth and informality, not size or impressiveness.

## Format and Flow

### Sample Schedule (2 Hours)

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 5:00 - 5:30 | Arrival, mingling, appetizers |
| 5:30 - 5:45 | Welcome and introductions |
| 5:45 - 6:15 | Pastor shares vision and story |
| 6:15 - 6:30 | Q&A |
| 6:30 - 6:45 | Next steps and invitation |
| 6:45 - 7:00 | Continued fellowship, dessert |

### Arrival and Mingling (30 min)

- Greet guests warmly at the door
- Introduce them to others
- Offer food and drinks
- Keep the atmosphere light and conversational

### Welcome and Introductions (15 min)

- Thank everyone for coming
- Have each person share their name, how they found the church, and one fun fact
- This warms up the room and helps people connect

### Pastor's Sharing (30 min)

The pastor should share:

- **Personal testimony** — How they came to faith and ministry
- **Church story** — How this church plant came to be
- **Church vision** — Where the church is headed and why it matters
- **Church values** — What makes this church distinct

Keep it conversational, not preachy. Stories are more powerful than bullet points.

### Q&A (15 min)

Open the floor for questions:

- "What questions do you have about the church?"
- "What would you like to know that we haven't covered?"
- "Is there anything that's unclear about who we are or what we believe?"

<Callout type="tip">
  Prepare a few questions in advance in case the group is shy. You can ask 
  them to the group or have a church member planted to ask them.
</Callout>

### Next Steps and Invitation (15 min)

Close by clearly explaining next steps:

- **Membership class** — When it is, what it covers, how to sign up
- **Small groups** — Why they matter, how to join
- **Serving** — Opportunities available, how to explore

Make it easy to respond:

- Provide sign-up cards
- Have someone follow up personally with each attendee
- Send a follow-up email with links and information

### Continued Fellowship (15 min)

Don't rush people out. Some of the best conversations happen after the formal time ends.

## Hospitality Details

### Food

Keep it simple but welcoming:

- Heavy appetizers or a simple meal
- Dessert and coffee
- Nothing fancy—the goal is warmth, not impressiveness

Consider having church members help prepare and serve so the pastor can focus on guests.

### Seating

Arrange seating to encourage conversation:

- Living room style (not rows)
- Everyone should be able to see the pastor
- Leave space for latecomers

### Atmosphere

- Clean and welcoming home
- Background music during arrival
- Good lighting (not too dim)
- Comfortable temperature

## Follow-Up After the Event

Party with the Pastor doesn't end when guests leave. Follow up within the week:

### Immediate

- Thank everyone for attending (group text or email is fine)
- Send any information promised during Q&A

### Within One Week

- Personal call or text to each attendee
- Check if they have additional questions
- Invite them to their next step (membership class, small group, etc.)

### Ongoing

- Track their movement through the assimilation pathway
- Continue to build relationship
- Celebrate when they take next steps

<Callout type="important">
  The follow-up is as important as the event itself. Without intentional 
  follow-up, the connection made at Party with the Pastor will fade.
</Callout>

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Too formal** — This should feel like a party, not a lecture
- **Too long** — Respect people's time; two hours is plenty
- **Pastor dominates** — Ask questions, listen, and let guests talk
- **No clear next step** — Always end with a clear invitation
- **Forgetting follow-up** — The event is just the beginning

Hospitality opens hearts. When you welcome people into your home and life, you create space for God to work in ways that formal programs cannot.
