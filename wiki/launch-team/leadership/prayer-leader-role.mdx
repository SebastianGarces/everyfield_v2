The Prayer Leader develops and leads the prayer ministry of the church—ensuring that prayer remains central to everything the church does. In a busy launch season filled with tasks, meetings, and deadlines, the Prayer Leader keeps the church dependent on God.

This role may have less visibility than others, but it is foundational. Church planting is spiritual work that requires spiritual power.

## Why Prayer Leadership Matters

Prayer is one of the 8 Critical Success Factors: "A commitment to consistent, fervent prayer which permeates the Core Group." This doesn't happen automatically. It requires intentional leadership.

Without focused prayer leadership:
- Prayer becomes an afterthought tacked onto meetings
- The church relies on its own efforts rather than God's power
- Spiritual warfare goes unaddressed
- The launch becomes a human project rather than a divine work

<Callout type="insight">
  Every successful church plant can point to a foundation of prayer. The work that matters most is often the work no one sees—people on their knees calling out to God.

## Core Responsibilities

### Develops Prayer Strategy for Upholding the Pillar of Prayer

The Prayer Leader creates a comprehensive approach to prayer that includes:

**Corporate prayer gatherings.** Regular times when the church gathers specifically to pray.

**Prayer during services.** How prayer is incorporated into Sunday worship.

**Individual prayer.** Encouraging and equipping members in personal prayer.

**Special prayer initiatives.** Focused prayer efforts for specific needs or seasons.

**Prayer communication.** Systems for sharing prayer requests across the body.

### Develops Prayer Teams Within Church

Prayer teams provide focused intercession:

**Sunday prayer team.** People who pray during services for the service, the pastor, and those attending.

**Prayer partners.** Trained individuals who pray with people after services or during ministry times.

**Intercessors.** People with particular gifts in prayer who commit to regular intercession for the church.

The Prayer Leader recruits, trains, and coordinates these teams.

### Keeps Vital Prayer Requests in Front of Body Through Email

The Prayer Leader maintains ongoing communication about prayer:

- Regular prayer updates to the congregation
- Urgent prayer requests when needs arise
- Praise reports when prayers are answered
- Reminders of ongoing prayer commitments

This communication keeps prayer visible and helps the body pray with one voice.

### Plans and Coordinates Corporate Prayer Gatherings

Beyond prayers in regular services, the Prayer Leader plans dedicated prayer gatherings:

**Prayer meetings.** Regular times for the church to gather for focused prayer.

**Prayer and fasting.** Coordinated seasons of fasting with prayer.

**Prayer events.** Special gatherings such as nights of worship and prayer.

**Prayer walks.** Praying on-site in the community where God is calling you.

<Callout type="tip">
  Corporate prayer gatherings are powerful but often poorly attended. Make them meaningful, not just long. Consider creative formats—prayer walks, prayer stations, guided prayer with worship.

## Key Skills and Qualities

The ideal Prayer Leader brings:

**Personal prayer life.** You cannot lead where you do not go. The Prayer Leader must be a person of deep personal prayer.

**Spiritual maturity.** Sensitivity to the Holy Spirit's leading and discernment in spiritual matters.

**Passion for prayer.** Genuine conviction that prayer matters and enthusiasm that inspires others.

**Leadership ability.** Capacity to mobilize and coordinate prayer efforts.

**Communication skills.** Ability to communicate prayer needs clearly and compellingly.

**Humility.** Prayer leadership is often behind-the-scenes work with little recognition.

**Availability.** Willingness to pray—and lead prayer—at various times and in various settings.

## Prayer in the Launch Season

The launch season requires intensified prayer focus. The Prayer Leader helps by:

**Mobilizing prayer support.** Ensure people are praying consistently for the launch.

**Identifying specific needs.** What exactly should people pray for? Leadership? Facilities? Provision? Hearts?

**Coordinating prayer and fasting.** As launch approaches, consider dedicated fasting periods.

**Modeling dependence.** Remind the team that success comes from God, not just good execution.

### Recommended: Fasting Leading Up to Launch

During the final month before launch:

- Schedule one day a week for fasting
- Fasts can end with corporate worship and prayer followed by a shared meal
- The Senior Pastor needs to lead and participate in this process

This concentrated spiritual focus prepares hearts for what God wants to do on Launch Sunday.

## Prayer Team Development

Building prayer teams requires intentional recruitment and training:

**Identify intercessors.** Some people have particular gifts and passion for prayer. Find them.

**Train prayer partners.** Those who pray with others need training in how to listen, pray effectively, and maintain confidentiality.

**Establish commitments.** Be clear about expectations—when prayer teams meet, how long they serve, what's required.

**Appreciate regularly.** Prayer warriors often serve invisibly. Make sure they know their work matters.

## Prayer During Services

Work with the Senior Pastor and Worship Leader to incorporate prayer meaningfully into services:

| Prayer Element | Considerations |
|----------------|----------------|
| Opening prayer | Sets tone for worship; avoid rushed formality |
| Pastoral prayer | Opportunity for the pastor to lead congregation in prayer |
| Response time | Space for people to respond in prayer to the message |
| Prayer ministry | Availability for prayer after service |
| Intercessory team | People praying throughout the service |

<Callout type="warning">
  Prayer in services can become routine and meaningless if not led with intentionality. Help ensure prayer times are genuine encounters, not just transitions.
</Callout>

## Maintaining Prayer Focus After Launch

After launch, the temptation is to reduce prayer focus as "regular" church life begins. The Prayer Leader guards against this by:

- Maintaining prayer rhythms established before launch
- Continuing to communicate prayer needs
- Keeping prayer teams active and engaged
- Reminding leadership of prayer's centrality
