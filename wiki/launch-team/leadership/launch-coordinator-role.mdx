description: A detailed guide to the Launch Coordinator role—the project manager who keeps the church launch on schedule and on budget.

*/}

The Launch Coordinator is the project manager of the church plant. While the Senior Pastor provides vision and overall leadership, the Launch Coordinator ensures all the pieces come together on time and within budget.

This role is essential. Many church plants have struggled not because of lack of vision but because of poor execution. The Launch Coordinator prevents that.

## Why This Role Matters

Good project management is essential to an excellent launch. Managing details is only one part—equally important is coordination of critical pathways and ensuring deadlines are met.

Many Senior Pastors lack the gifting or attention to detail for effective project management. This isn't a character flaw; it's simply a different skill set. Wise pastors recognize this and find someone to complement their strengths.

  The Launch Coordinator frees the Senior Pastor to focus on vision, leadership, and pastoral care while ensuring nothing falls through the cracks. This partnership multiplies the effectiveness of both.

## Core Responsibilities

The Launch Coordinator's responsibilities can be summarized with six key functions:

### 1. OWN the Launch Process

The Launch Coordinator owns the launch process under the Senior Pastor's leadership. "Own" means taking full responsibility for execution—not waiting to be told what to do, but proactively managing the entire project.

This requires:
- Deep understanding of all launch components
- Initiative to identify and solve problems
- Willingness to do whatever needs to be done
- Commitment equal to the Senior Pastor's

### 2. LEAD the Project Team

The Launch Coordinator leads the project by building a cohesive and coordinated leader team. This involves:

- Facilitating communication between ministry leaders
- Ensuring ministry areas work together rather than in silos
- Identifying dependencies between areas
- Resolving coordination challenges

Note: The Launch Coordinator doesn't replace the Senior Pastor's leadership of ministry leaders. Rather, they coordinate the project execution while the Senior Pastor provides vision and pastoral leadership.

### 3. DEVELOP the Timeline

The Launch Coordinator develops the project timeline, milestones, and critical pathways. This includes:

**Timeline creation.** Work backward from Launch Sunday to identify all tasks and when they must be completed.

**Milestones.** Establish key checkpoints that indicate whether the project is on track.

**Critical pathways.** Identify dependencies—tasks that can't begin until other tasks are complete. A delay in a critical pathway task delays the entire launch.

<Callout type="tip">
  Use the Launch Project Schedule document as a starting point, then work with your Senior Pastor and ministry leaders to customize it for your context.
</Callout>

### 4. MANAGE the Timeline

Creating a timeline is only the beginning. The Launch Coordinator manages the timeline by:

- Tracking progress against plan
- Identifying tasks that are behind schedule
- Informing leaders of upcoming deadlines
- Escalating issues that threaten the timeline
- Adjusting plans when circumstances change

### 5. SCHEDULE and Chair Meetings

Regular project meetings keep key leaders informed and working together. The Launch Coordinator:

- Schedules project meetings at appropriate intervals
- Prepares agendas focused on progress, problems, and next steps
- Facilitates productive meetings
- Documents decisions and action items
- Follows up to ensure commitments are kept

### 6. BRING the Launch In On Schedule and Budget

The ultimate measure of the Launch Coordinator's success: the church launches on time and within budget. This requires:

- Relentless attention to detail
- Willingness to have difficult conversations when areas are behind
- Problem-solving creativity when obstacles arise
- Financial awareness and budget tracking
- Persistence through the final weeks when intensity peaks

## Key Skills and Qualities

The ideal Launch Coordinator possesses:

**Project management skills.** Experience managing complex projects with multiple stakeholders and dependencies.

**Attention to detail.** Ability to track many moving parts without losing sight of any.

**Organizational ability.** Systems and processes for keeping information organized and accessible.

**Communication skills.** Clear, direct communication that keeps everyone informed.

**Diplomacy.** Ability to coordinate between ministry leaders without creating conflict.

**Flexibility.** Willingness to adjust plans when circumstances change.

**Servant leadership.** Desire to serve the Senior Pastor and the church, not build a personal empire.

## Working with the Senior Pastor

The relationship between Senior Pastor and Launch Coordinator is critical. To work well together:

**Establish clear expectations.** What decisions can the Launch Coordinator make independently? What requires the Senior Pastor's input?

**Communicate regularly.** Meet weekly to review progress, discuss challenges, and align on priorities.

**Trust each other.** The Senior Pastor must trust the Launch Coordinator to manage details. The Launch Coordinator must trust the Senior Pastor's vision and leadership.

**Stay in your lanes.** The Senior Pastor focuses on vision, people, and preaching. The Launch Coordinator focuses on execution, timelines, and coordination. Overlap should be minimal.

| Senior Pastor Responsibilities | Launch Coordinator Responsibilities |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Cast vision | Translate vision into tasks |
| Lead and shepherd people | Coordinate people and timelines |
| Make strategic decisions | Execute decisions effectively |
| Develop ministry leaders | Keep ministry leaders on track |
| Preach and teach | Ensure teaching materials are ready |

## Tools and Methods

### Gantt Chart

A Gantt chart is highly recommended for visualizing the project timeline. It shows:
- All tasks and their durations
- Dependencies between tasks
- Critical pathway items
- Progress against plan

Many software options exist—from Microsoft Project to simpler tools like TeamGantt or even Google Sheets.

### Project Meetings

Regular project meetings should include:
- Ministry leader updates on progress
- Review of upcoming deadlines
- Discussion of obstacles and solutions
- Coordination between interdependent areas
- Prayer for God's guidance and provision

### Communication Systems

Establish clear communication channels:
- Where are documents stored?
- How are decisions communicated?
- How do leaders report progress?
- How are urgent issues escalated?

<Callout type="warning">
  Unclear communication causes more project failures than any other factor. Invest time upfront in establishing clear systems.
</Callout>

## Common Challenges

### Challenge: Leaders Don't Meet Deadlines

**Solution:** Identify the cause. Is the deadline unrealistic? Does the leader lack resources? Are they unclear on expectations? Address the root cause rather than just pushing harder.

### Challenge: Senior Pastor Changes Direction

**Solution:** Build flexibility into the timeline. Maintain open communication so changes are discussed rather than announced. Help the Senior Pastor understand the impact of changes on the overall project.

### Challenge: Scope Creep

**Solution:** Maintain a clear list of what's "in scope" for launch. When new ideas arise, evaluate whether they're essential for launch or can be added later.

### Challenge: Ministry Silos

**Solution:** Regular all-leader meetings create visibility across areas. Highlight interdependencies explicitly. Foster a culture of teamwork over individual accomplishment.
