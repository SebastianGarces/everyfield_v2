The Facilities Leader owns everything related to the physical space where your church meets. In a portable church, this means finding and securing a venue, managing the relationship with the property owner, and ensuring weekly setup and teardown runs smoothly.

This role may not be glamorous, but it's foundational. Without a place to meet, there's no church service.

## Core Responsibilities

### Finds and Secures Facility for Sunday Services

Finding the right venue is one of the most critical tasks in the launch process. The Facilities Leader:

**Researches options.** Schools, community centers, movie theaters, hotel conference rooms, and other venues that could work for Sunday services.

**Evaluates suitability.** Does the space accommodate your anticipated attendance? Is there space for children's ministry? Is it accessible and in a good location?

**Negotiates terms.** Works with property owners to secure favorable rental agreements.

**Manages contracts.** Ensures all agreements are documented and obligations are clear.

<Callout type="tip">
  Begin the venue search early. Finding and securing the right space often takes longer than expected. Start looking as soon as your geographic area is identified.
</Callout>

### Serves as Primary Contact with Facility Owner

Once a venue is secured, the Facilities Leader becomes the ongoing point of contact:

- Handles communication with the facility owner
- Addresses any concerns or issues that arise
- Ensures the church meets all contractual obligations
- Builds a positive, trusting relationship

### Closely Manages Relationship with Facility Owner

The relationship with your venue owner matters enormously. A good relationship means:
- Flexibility when you need it
- Willingness to accommodate growth
- Potential for long-term partnership
- Positive word-of-mouth in the community

A poor relationship means constant tension, restrictions, and potential loss of the venue.

**Best practices:**
- Communicate proactively about any issues
- Leave the facility cleaner than you found it
- Address any damage immediately and honestly
- Express appreciation regularly
- Pay rent on time, every time

### Reviews Weekly the Proper Care of the Facility

The Facilities Leader ensures the venue is treated well every week:

- Conducts post-teardown inspections
- Addresses any issues before they become problems
- Trains teams on proper care of the space
- Documents and reports any pre-existing damage

<Callout type="warning">
  How you treat your rented facility reflects on your church's character. One careless incident can damage years of relationship building. Make facility care a priority.
</Callout>

### Oversees All Set-Up and Tear-Down

Weekly setup and teardown is a major operation. The Facilities Leader:

**Develops efficient processes.** What order should things be set up? How can teams work in parallel?

**Trains teams.** Ensures everyone knows their responsibilities and how to execute them.

**Schedules teams.** Creates rotation schedules so the same people aren't always serving.

**Manages equipment.** Ensures all equipment is properly stored, transported, and maintained.

**Coordinates with other leaders.** Works closely with the Worship Leader (production setup) and Children's Ministry Leader (children's area setup).

### Oversees Signage (Outside and Inside)

Visitors need to find you and navigate your space. The Facilities Leader ensures:

**Exterior signage.** Directional signs, parking lot signage, entrance banners.

**Interior signage.** Welcome area, directional signs to worship and children's areas, restrooms.

**Portable signage solutions.** Signs that can be set up and taken down weekly.

### Oversees Parking

Parking affects first impressions. The Facilities Leader coordinates:

- Signage directing people to parking areas
- Parking lot greeters (in coordination with Assimilation Leaders)
- Traffic flow for arrival and departure
- Accessibility considerations

### Responsible for Office Space

Beyond Sunday services, the church may need office space for staff. The Facilities Leader helps secure and manage this space.

### Develops Long-Term Facilities Plan

While addressing immediate needs, the Facilities Leader also thinks ahead:

- What facilities will we need as we grow?
- When should we begin looking for larger or permanent space?
- What are the options in our area?
- How do we prepare financially for facilities transitions?

### Constantly Looks for Future Facilities Options

Keep a running list of potential future venues. Building relationships with property owners before you need them makes transitions smoother.

## Venue Selection Criteria

When evaluating potential venues, consider:

| Factor | Questions to Ask |
|--------|------------------|
| **Location** | Is it accessible? Central to your target area? Easy to find? |
| **Size** | Does it accommodate your current and near-term anticipated attendance? |
| **Children's space** | Is there adequate space for children's ministry? |
| **Setup access** | How early can you access the space? Is there time for proper setup? |
| **Storage** | Can you store equipment on-site or nearby? |
| **Cost** | Is the rental cost sustainable within your budget? |
| **Availability** | Is the space consistently available when you need it? |
| **Aesthetics** | Does the space create the atmosphere you want? |
| **Parking** | Is there adequate parking for your anticipated attendance? |
| **Acoustics** | Will sound work well in this space? |

## Building the Setup/Teardown Team

Setup and teardown require many hands. Build your team by:

**Recruiting broadly.** Many people who may not serve in other visible ministries are willing to serve in setup.

**Creating clear roles.** Break setup into specific tasks with clear ownership.

**Using rotation schedules.** Prevent burnout by rotating teams.

**Starting early.** The earlier you build this team, the more refined your processes become before launch.

**Appreciating well.** Setup teams often serve invisibly. Make sure they feel valued.

<Callout type="insight">
  Setup teams often become tight-knit communities. The early morning shared work creates bonds. Foster this community—it increases retention and satisfaction.
</Callout>

## Portable Church Equipment

The Facilities Leader works with other leaders to ensure all portable church equipment is:

- Properly maintained
- Correctly stored
- Safely transported
- Set up according to specifications
- Torn down without damage

Coordinate with the Worship Leader on production equipment and the Children's Ministry Leader on children's ministry equipment.

Facilities work is kingdom work. Every chair set up, every sign placed, every sound check completed creates space for people to encounter God.
