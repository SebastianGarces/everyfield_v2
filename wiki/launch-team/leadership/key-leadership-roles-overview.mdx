A successful church launch requires more than a Senior Pastor with a vision. It requires a team of leaders who take ownership of specific responsibilities, bringing their gifts and passion to bear on the mission.

This article provides an overview of the key leadership roles needed to launch well. Each role is essential to creating a cohesive, effective Launch Team.

## Why Leadership Roles Matter

One of the 8 Critical Success Factors is **Emerging Leadership**—leadership that rises from within the Core Group to comprehensively own the primary responsibilities of the launch. Without this, the Senior Pastor carries too much weight, critical details fall through cracks, and the launch suffers.

  Church planting is a team sport. The Senior Pastor who tries to do everything alone will burn out before Launch Sunday. The pastor who develops leaders will multiply impact and build a healthier church from day one.

When you identify and empower the right leaders, several things happen:

- **Shared ownership** — The weight of the launch is distributed across capable shoulders
- **Excellence** — Each area receives focused attention from someone with relevant gifts
- **Sustainability** — Leaders who own ministries from the start continue leading after launch
- **Multiplication** — Leaders develop other leaders within their areas

## The Ten Leadership Roles

Your Launch Team needs leaders for these ten areas:

| Role | Primary Focus |
|------|---------------|
| **Senior Pastor** | Overall vision, leadership, and shepherding |
| **Launch Coordinator** | Project management and timeline execution |
| **Worship Leader** | Sunday service production and worship teams |
| **Children's Ministry Leader** | All children's programming and safety |
| **Facilities Leader** | Venue logistics and setup/teardown |
| **Assimilation Leaders** | Guest experience and follow-up systems |
| **Small Group Leader** | Community and discipleship through groups |
| **Promotion Leader** | Marketing and community awareness |
| **Technology Leader** | Website, systems, and production tech |
| **Prayer Leader** | Prayer strategy and spiritual preparation |

Not every role requires the same level of experience or time commitment. Some roles—like Worship Leader and Children's Ministry Leader—demand significant expertise and availability. Others—like Prayer Leader—can be filled by someone with a smaller time commitment but deep spiritual maturity.

## Finding the Right People

As your Core Group grows, pay attention to who naturally rises to the surface. The best leaders often emerge rather than being recruited from outside.

### What to Look For

**Character over competence.** Skills can be developed; character takes much longer. Look for people who demonstrate integrity, humility, and servant leadership.

**Passion for the area.** The best Facilities Leader actually enjoys logistics. The best Children's Ministry Leader lights up when talking about kids. Passion fuels perseverance.

**Proven faithfulness.** Have they been faithful in smaller responsibilities? Jesus taught that faithfulness in little leads to faithfulness in much.

**Alignment with vision.** Do they understand and embrace the church's distinctives? Leaders who don't share the vision will eventually pull in a different direction.

**Coachability.** Are they willing to learn, receive feedback, and grow? No one comes to a church plant fully equipped for their role.

<Callout type="tip">
  Start identifying potential leaders early in the Core Group phase. Give them small responsibilities and watch how they handle them. Those who prove faithful can be entrusted with larger roles.
</Callout>

### What to Avoid

**Desperation appointments.** Don't put someone in a role just because you need the position filled. A wrong leader causes more problems than an empty position.

**Lone rangers.** Avoid people who want to build their own kingdom rather than serve the church's mission.

**High maintenance leaders.** Some people require more energy to manage than they contribute. Choose leaders who add energy rather than drain it.

## The Senior Pastor's Role in Leadership Development

While each leader owns their area, the Senior Pastor has responsibility for developing these leaders. This includes:

- **Vision casting** — Helping each leader understand how their area connects to the overall mission
- **Equipping** — Providing training, resources, and guidance
- **Empowering** — Giving authority along with responsibility
- **Accountability** — Regular check-ins to ensure progress and address challenges
- **Encouragement** — Recognizing effort and celebrating wins

The goal is not micromanagement but multiplication. The Senior Pastor should be working to develop leaders who can develop other leaders.

## When Roles Can't Be Filled

What if you can't find someone for a critical role? This is common, especially for specialized positions like Worship Leader.

**Don't lower your standards.** It's better to wait for the right person than settle for someone who isn't a fit.

**Consider temporary solutions.** Can someone cover the role on an interim basis? Can you borrow help from a partner church?

**Adjust your timeline if necessary.** One of the variables that drives your launch date is having key leadership in place. If you're missing critical roles, it may be wise to delay.

**Keep praying and looking.** God knows what your church needs. Continue asking Him to raise up the right people.

<Callout type="important">
  The Worship Leader and Children's Ministry Leader roles are especially critical. Most churches cannot launch without effective leadership in these two areas. Make filling these positions a high priority.

## Building a Leadership Team Culture

As your leaders come together, intentionally build a healthy team culture:

**Meet regularly.** Bring all leaders together for coordination, prayer, and mutual encouragement. This is different from individual ministry team meetings.

**Communicate clearly.** Keep everyone informed of decisions, timeline changes, and overall progress. The Launch Coordinator plays a key role here.

**Resolve conflict quickly.** Don't let tensions fester. Address issues directly and graciously.

**Celebrate together.** Acknowledge progress, thank people for their sacrifice, and build genuine relationships.

**Pray together.** Never let the work of launching crowd out dependence on God. Regular prayer as a leadership team keeps priorities straight.

God gives leaders to the church not to do all the ministry, but to equip others for ministry. As you build your leadership team, you're participating in God's design for how the church grows and matures.
