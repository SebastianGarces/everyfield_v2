The Senior Pastor is the primary leader of the church plant. While a successful launch requires a team, the Senior Pastor provides the vision, direction, and spiritual leadership that holds everything together.

This is both a tremendous privilege and a weighty responsibility. The health of the church largely flows from the health of the Senior Pastor's leadership.

## Core Responsibilities

The Senior Pastor's responsibilities cluster around six primary areas:

### 1. Overall Leadership of the Launch

The Senior Pastor owns the launch. Not in isolation—the Launch Coordinator manages the project details—but in terms of ultimate accountability. The Senior Pastor sets the direction, makes key decisions, and ensures all pieces work together toward a cohesive launch.

This means:
- Setting strategic priorities
- Making final decisions when the team is divided
- Removing obstacles that block progress
- Maintaining momentum when energy flags
- Modeling the commitment you expect from others

### 2. Vision Casting

The Senior Pastor must continually cast vision—painting a compelling picture of what God is building and why it matters. This isn't a one-time activity but an ongoing discipline.

**Vision leaks.** People forget. Life crowds out priorities. The Senior Pastor regularly reminds the team where they're going and why.

**Vision inspires.** When people catch the vision, they work harder, sacrifice more, and recruit others. Vision is the fuel that powers the launch.

**Vision aligns.** A clear, consistently communicated vision keeps everyone pulling in the same direction.

<Callout type="tip">
  Find multiple ways to cast vision: teaching, storytelling, one-on-one conversations, written communication. Different people connect with vision through different channels.
</Callout>

### 3. Building Teams

The Senior Pastor identifies, recruits, and develops the leaders who will own key ministry areas. This is one of the most important things you do.

Building teams involves:
- Identifying potential leaders within the Core Group
- Casting vision for specific roles and inviting people to lead
- Providing training and resources for each leader
- Creating clarity around roles, responsibilities, and authority
- Coaching leaders through challenges
- Holding leaders accountable for results

### 4. Preaching and Teaching

The Senior Pastor is the primary preacher. This includes:

**Preaching calendar.** Plan your teaching themes for the ministry year. Consider what your congregation needs to hear, seasonal opportunities, and the natural rhythm of church life.

**Message preparation.** Invest adequate time in sermon preparation. Your preaching shapes the culture, values, and direction of the church.

**Peak Performance and membership classes.** Develop and teach the foundational classes that establish people in the church.

### 5. Shepherding the Flock

The Senior Pastor is not only a leader and teacher but a shepherd. People in your church need pastoral care—especially during the intense season of launching.

This includes:
- Being available for significant life moments (births, deaths, crises)
- Providing pastoral counseling when appropriate
- Knowing your people—their names, stories, and struggles
- Modeling vulnerability and authenticity

<Callout type="warning">
  Don't let the busyness of launching crowd out pastoral care. People joined this church plant because of relationship with you. Maintain those relationships even as demands increase.

### 6. Developing and Equipping Leaders

Your long-term effectiveness multiplies through the leaders you develop. Invest in them intentionally:

- Meet regularly with key leaders for coaching and encouragement
- Provide training opportunities—both formal and informal
- Give leaders increasing responsibility as they prove faithful
- Create a culture where leaders develop other leaders

## Key Relationships

### Reporting to Elders

The Senior Pastor reports to the Elder board on a regular basis. This relationship provides:
- **Accountability** — Elders hold the Senior Pastor accountable for leadership and character
- **Wisdom** — Elders provide counsel on significant decisions
- **Support** — Elders encourage and advocate for the Senior Pastor

Maintain open, honest communication with your Elders. Don't hide struggles or challenges. The Elder relationship only works when built on trust.

### Working with the Launch Coordinator

The Launch Coordinator manages the project details under the Senior Pastor's leadership. This partnership is essential:

| Senior Pastor | Launch Coordinator |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Sets vision and direction | Translates vision into actionable plans |
| Makes strategic decisions | Manages tactical execution |
| Leads people | Manages timelines and tasks |
| Focuses on the "what" and "why" | Focuses on the "how" and "when" |

Meet regularly with your Launch Coordinator. Stay informed on progress without micromanaging. Trust them to handle details while you focus on leadership.

### Leading the Ministry Team Leaders

Each ministry area has a designated leader. The Senior Pastor:
- Casts vision for each ministry area
- Provides guidance and resources
- Holds leaders accountable for progress
- Resolves conflicts between ministry areas
- Encourages and appreciates leaders

## Ensuring Distinctives Are Instilled

One critical responsibility is ensuring the church's distinctives—the 4 Pillars, core values, and DNA—are thoroughly instilled in the Launch Team.

**Teach them repeatedly.** Use Core Group meetings, Launch Team gatherings, and training sessions to reinforce distinctives.

**Model them personally.** People learn more from what you do than what you say.

**Hire and develop for them.** When evaluating potential leaders, assess their alignment with distinctives.

**Correct drift.** When you see the church moving away from its distinctives, address it promptly.

## What the Senior Pastor Should Not Do

### Don't Handle Money

The Senior Pastor should not handle any money or write any checks. This is great protection—it removes any possible accusation about financial impropriety and frees you to preach boldly about giving without concern about how it affects your relationship with donors.

<Callout type="important">
  Since the Senior Pastor doesn't know what anyone gives, you're free to preach without worrying about how the message affects anyone or the budget. This separation is intentional and protective.
</Callout>

### Don't Do Everything

Resist the temptation to fill every gap yourself. When something isn't getting done:
1. First, see if there's someone who could own it
2. If not, evaluate whether it truly needs to be done
3. Only take it on yourself as a last resort

The Senior Pastor who does everything develops a church that can't function without them.

### Don't Neglect Your Soul

In the intensity of launching, it's easy to let personal spiritual disciplines slip. Don't. Your church needs a spiritually healthy pastor more than a productive one.

- Maintain your prayer life
- Stay in the Word personally, not just for sermon prep
- Sabbath regularly
- Nurture your marriage and family
- Find sources of refreshment outside ministry

  *"Pay careful attention to yourselves and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to care for the church of God, which he obtained with his own blood."* — Acts 20:28

The church you're planting was purchased with the blood of Christ. Lead it with that weight and that privilege in mind.
