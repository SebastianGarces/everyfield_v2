The Small Group Leader oversees the small group ministry—the primary vehicle for community, care, and discipleship in the church. While Sunday services gather the congregation, small groups are where life-on-life ministry happens.

A church without healthy small groups is a church where people remain disconnected, unaccountable, and spiritually stagnant.

## Why Small Groups Matter

Small groups accomplish what Sunday services cannot:

**Community.** In a small group, people know your name, your story, and your struggles. They're not anonymous faces in a crowd.

**Accountability.** Small groups provide relationships where people can speak into each other's lives.

**Care.** When crisis hits, small group members are the first responders—bringing meals, offering support, and walking alongside.

**Discipleship.** Spiritual growth happens through relationship, not just information. Small groups provide the relational context for transformation.

**Leadership development.** Small groups are where future leaders are identified and developed.

## Core Responsibilities

### Oversees Entire Small Group Ministry Under Senior Pastor's Leadership

The Small Group Leader builds and manages all aspects of small group ministry in alignment with the church's vision:

- Understands and implements the church's small group philosophy
- Develops systems and structures for effective groups
- Reports regularly to the Senior Pastor on ministry health
- Addresses challenges and makes improvements

### Thoroughly Understands and Can Teach Small Group Model

The Small Group Leader is the resident expert on small groups:

- Understands the theological foundation for groups
- Can articulate the church's specific small group model
- Teaches small group philosophy to leaders and members
- Champions small groups throughout the church

### Identifies and Trains Small Group Leaders with Senior Pastor

The quality of small groups depends on the quality of their leaders. The Small Group Leader:

**Identifies potential leaders.** Looks for people with spiritual maturity, relational gifts, and leadership potential.

**Recruits leaders.** Casts vision for small group leadership and invites qualified people to lead.

**Trains leaders.** Provides initial training and ongoing development.

**Supports leaders.** Offers resources, coaching, and encouragement.

### Organizes and Oversees Small Group 101 Training

Small Group 101 is foundational training for anyone considering small group leadership. The Small Group Leader:

- Develops or adapts curriculum
- Schedules and promotes training sessions
- Teaches or coordinates teachers
- Follows up with participants about next steps

### Assigns Individuals to Small Groups

As people express interest in joining groups, the Small Group Leader:

- Understands available groups and their focus
- Matches individuals to appropriate groups
- Facilitates introductions to group leaders
- Follows up to ensure successful connection

<Callout type="tip">
  Don't just assign people randomly. Consider geography, life stage, interests, and schedule when matching people to groups. Good matches increase retention.
</Callout>

### Trains and Manages Small Group Coaches

As the number of groups grows, the Small Group Leader can't directly oversee every leader. Coaches provide an intermediate layer:

- Each coach oversees 3-5 small group leaders
- Coaches provide regular encouragement and support
- Coaches identify issues early and escalate when needed
- The Small Group Leader trains and supports coaches

### Implements Apprentice Program

Healthy groups multiply. The apprentice model ensures this happens:

- Every small group has an identified apprentice
- Apprentices receive training and mentoring
- Apprentices gradually take on leadership responsibilities
- When groups multiply, apprentices become leaders

## Key Skills and Qualities

The ideal Small Group Leader brings:

**Passion for community.** Deep conviction about the importance of small group life.

**Leadership ability.** Capacity to build and lead a team of group leaders.

**Teaching ability.** Can effectively communicate small group philosophy and train leaders.

**Relational warmth.** People feel comfortable approaching them.

**Organizational skills.** Ability to track many groups, leaders, and individuals.

**Coaching ability.** Can develop other leaders through support and feedback.

**Patience.** Small group ministry growth is often slow and requires persistence.

---

## Small Group Philosophy

Work with the Senior Pastor to establish your small group philosophy. Consider:

**Purpose.** What are groups supposed to accomplish? Community? Discipleship? Care? Evangelism? All of the above?

**Structure.** Sermon-based? Curriculum-based? Book study? Topical?

**Meeting rhythm.** Weekly? Bi-weekly? How long does a group "semester" last?

**Multiplication expectation.** How and when do groups multiply?

**Leadership requirements.** What qualifications must group leaders have?

**Apprentice model.** How do you develop new leaders within groups?

---

## Launching Small Groups

For a church plant, small groups typically launch shortly after Launch Sunday. The Small Group Leader:

**Prepares leaders in advance.** Group leaders should be identified and trained before launch.

**Plans the rollout.** When will groups be announced? How will people sign up?

**Creates promotional materials.** Group descriptions, sign-up processes, and information.

**Coordinates with Assimilation Leaders.** Connecting guests to groups is part of assimilation.

**Launches with excellence.** First impressions of small groups matter.

---

## Common Challenges

### Challenge: Not Enough Leaders

**Solution:** Start leadership development early. Use the apprentice model. Lower barriers to entry-level leadership while maintaining standards for lead leaders.

### Challenge: Groups That Don't Multiply

**Solution:** Build multiplication expectation into group culture from the start. Train apprentices consistently. Celebrate multiplication as success.

### Challenge: Unhealthy Groups

**Solution:** Regular check-ins with leaders identify problems early. Coach leaders on group dynamics. Be willing to address problems directly.

### Challenge: People Not Connecting

**Solution:** Simplify the sign-up process. Personally connect hesitant people. Address barriers to participation. Offer various group types.

<Callout type="warning">
  Small groups can become cliques that exclude newcomers. Guard against this by emphasizing hospitality, practicing the empty chair concept, and multiplying regularly.

## Measuring Small Group Health

Track these metrics:

- Percentage of regular attenders in groups
- Number of groups and leaders
- Average group size
- Group multiplication rate
- Leader retention
- Member satisfaction

Regular review helps identify areas needing attention.

  *"And let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works, not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another."* — Hebrews 10:24-25

Small groups are where "one anothering" happens—where believers stir each other toward love, encourage each other through difficulty, and grow together in Christ.
