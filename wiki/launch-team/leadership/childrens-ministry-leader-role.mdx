The Children's Ministry Leader oversees everything related to ministry to children. This role is critical because excellent children's ministry determines whether young families stay at your church.

Parents evaluate a church largely based on their children's experience. A child who loves church creates a family that loves church. A child who dreads Sundays creates a family that stops coming.

## Why This Role Is Critical

Children's ministry is not babysitting while adults have church. It's strategic ministry that:

- **Reaches families.** Young families often choose churches based on children's programming quality
- **Disciples the next generation.** Kids are forming their understanding of God, faith, and church
- **Enables parents to worship.** Parents can't engage in worship if worried about their children
- **Multiplies impact.** Reach a child, influence a family for decades

  The Worship Leader and Children's Ministry Leader are the two roles most churches cannot launch without. Make filling these positions a high priority.

## Core Responsibilities

### Oversees Entire Children's Ministry Under Senior Pastor's Leadership

The Children's Ministry Leader builds and leads all children's programming in alignment with the church's overall vision. This includes:

- Understanding the church's philosophy of children's ministry
- Developing age-appropriate programming
- Creating a unified approach across all age groups
- Reporting regularly to the Senior Pastor

### Identifies, Screens, and Trains Leaders and Helpers

Building the children's ministry team is ongoing:

**Identify.** Look for people with passion for kids, demonstrated maturity, and servant hearts.

**Screen.** Implement thorough background checks and screening procedures for everyone who works with children. This protects children and the church.

**Train.** Provide initial training and ongoing development for all team members.

| Training Area | Topics |
|---------------|--------|
| Classroom management | Age-appropriate techniques, behavior challenges |
| Curriculum | How to teach the material effectively |
| Safety | Emergency procedures, child protection policies |
| Philosophy | Why we do what we do, spiritual goals |

<Callout type="warning">
  Never compromise on background checks. Every person who works with children must be screened—no exceptions. This isn't optional; it's essential protection.
</Callout>

### Implements Children's Ministry Philosophy and Distinctives

Work with the Senior Pastor to articulate what your children's ministry believes and practices:

- What is the goal of children's ministry?
- What role do parents play?
- How do we balance fun with spiritual formation?
- What theological concepts are age-appropriate?

Once established, ensure all programming and team members align with this philosophy.

### Oversees Curriculum Choices

Select curriculum that:
- Aligns with the church's theology
- Is age-appropriate
- Engages kids effectively
- Can be implemented well by your team
- Fits your budget

You may use published curriculum, develop your own, or combine approaches. The Children's Ministry Leader makes these decisions with pastoral guidance.

### Ensures All Safety Requirements Are Implemented

Safety is non-negotiable. The Children's Ministry Leader ensures:

**Check-in systems.** Secure processes for dropping off and picking up children.

**Ratios.** Appropriate adult-to-child ratios for each age group.

**Two-adult rule.** At least two screened adults in every classroom.

**Emergency procedures.** Documented plans for medical emergencies, evacuations, and other situations.

**Facility safety.** Age-appropriate rooms, secure areas, and hazard-free environments.

**Allergy awareness.** Systems to track and accommodate children with allergies.

### Implements Attendance and Assimilation Processes

Track children's attendance and help families connect:

- Know which children are present each week
- Follow up with families of first-time guests
- Help children move through assimilation process
- Coordinate with overall church assimilation systems

### Orders Materials and Room Set-Up Equipment

Manage the logistics of children's ministry:

- Curriculum and supplies
- Furniture appropriate for a portable church
- Check-in equipment and supplies
- Classroom materials for each age group

### Oversees Children's Ministry Set-Up and Tear-Down

As a portable church, children's ministry requires significant setup. The Children's Ministry Leader:

- Develops efficient processes
- Trains and schedules teams
- Ensures equipment is properly stored and transported
- Coordinates with the Facilities Leader and Worship Leader

## Building the Team

Children's ministry requires many volunteers. The Children's Ministry Leader must continually recruit, train, and retain team members.

### Recruitment

Look for team members among:
- Parents with children in the ministry
- Grandparent-aged members with gifts for children
- Young adults who connect well with kids
- Anyone with experience in education or childcare

### Retention

Keep volunteers engaged by:
- Expressing genuine appreciation
- Providing adequate training and support
- Creating community among the team
- Giving volunteers appropriate breaks
- Listening to their feedback and concerns

<Callout type="tip">
  Rotation schedules help prevent burnout. Many volunteers can serve twice a month rather than every week. Plan your teams accordingly.
</Callout>

### Training

Every team member needs training on:
- Classroom procedures
- Safety and security protocols
- The curriculum being used
- How to handle common challenges
- Emergency procedures

## Age Groups to Consider

Typical children's ministry serves multiple age groups:

| Age Group | Considerations |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Infants/Nursery** | High adult-to-child ratios, safety paramount, simple routines |
| **Toddlers (1-2)** | Active movement, short attention spans, basic concepts |
| **Preschool (3-5)** | Story-based learning, hands-on activities, clear routines |
| **Elementary (K-5)** | Deeper teaching, interactive elements, age-appropriate engagement |

You may combine age groups initially based on numbers and volunteers, then separate as the church grows.

## Portable Church Challenges

Children's ministry in a portable church presents unique challenges:

**Setup time.** Children's areas often take longer to set up than the worship center. Plan accordingly.

**Storage.** Children's supplies—especially for infants—require significant storage space.

**Consistency.** Children benefit from consistency, but portable church means the environment changes weekly. Create consistency through routines, relationships, and recognizable elements.

**Space limitations.** Rented facilities may have limited space for children. Get creative with room usage.

## Working with Parents

The Children's Ministry Leader is the church's primary contact with parents regarding their children. This requires:

- Clear communication about policies and procedures
- Responsiveness to parent questions and concerns
- Partnership mindset—parents are the primary disciplers
- Grace when dealing with challenging situations
