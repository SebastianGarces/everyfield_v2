The Promotion Leader develops and executes the marketing and communication strategy that builds awareness of your church in the community. Before launch, this means getting the word out about your new church. After launch, it means maintaining visibility and reaching new people.

In a crowded marketplace of attention, intentional promotion ensures your church is findable by those who need it.

## Core Responsibilities

### Develops Launch Promotion Plan Under Senior Pastor's Leadership

The Promotion Leader creates a comprehensive plan for promoting the church launch:

- Identifies target audience
- Selects appropriate promotion channels
- Creates timeline for promotional activities
- Establishes budget and resource needs
- Aligns messaging with the church's vision and values

This plan is developed in collaboration with the Senior Pastor and approved before execution.

### Fully Executes Promotion Plan Prior to Launch

Planning is only valuable if executed. The Promotion Leader:

- Manages all promotional activities according to plan
- Coordinates with vendors, designers, and other partners
- Ensures deadlines are met
- Adjusts tactics based on results
- Reports progress to leadership

### Ensures Good Video and Photography Capture of Launch

Launch Sunday should be documented for future promotion and historical record. The Promotion Leader:

- Arranges for quality video recording of the service
- Ensures photography coverage of the day
- Coordinates with the Worship Leader on production needs
- Manages the capture without disrupting the service

<Callout type="tip">
  Launch Sunday video and photos will be used for years—on your website, in promotional materials, and in future vision casting. Invest in quality capture.

## Promotion Channels

The Promotion Leader evaluates and utilizes various promotional channels based on budget, audience, and effectiveness:

| Channel | Description | Considerations |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| **Social Media** | Facebook, Instagram, etc. | Low cost, targetable, requires consistent content |
| **Website** | Church website | Essential; must be clear and informative |
| **Invitation Cards** | Personal handouts | High conversion when used personally |
| **Direct Mail** | Postcards to homes | Broader reach, moderate response rates |
| **Door Hangers** | Neighborhood distribution | Labor intensive, localized impact |
| **Outdoor Signs** | Portable signs, banners | Builds local awareness |
| **Radio** | Announcements and ads | Expensive but broad reach |
| **Local Press** | Press releases | Free if picked up, uncertain coverage |
| **Partner Churches** | Announcements in other churches | Built-in credibility, limited reach |
| **Digital Advertising** | Facebook ads, Google ads | Highly targetable, requires expertise |

Not every channel will be used. The Promotion Leader recommends the mix based on available resources and target audience.

<Callout type="insight">
  The most effective promotion is personal invitation. All other channels support and multiply personal invitations by the Launch Team.

## Developing Promotional Messaging

All promotional materials need consistent messaging. Work with the Senior Pastor to establish:

**Core message.** What is the one thing you want people to know about your church?

**Value proposition.** Why should someone visit this church rather than another?

**Call to action.** What do you want people to do? (Visit on Launch Sunday, check the website, etc.)

**Tone and style.** What personality does your communication convey?

### Messaging Principles

- **Clarity over cleverness.** People should immediately understand what your church is.
- **Benefits over features.** Communicate what people will experience, not just what you offer.
- **Authentic over polished.** Be genuine; people can spot marketing spin.
- **Invitational over informational.** Every piece should invite a response.

## Timeline Considerations

Promotion activities need to be timed appropriately:

**Months before launch:**
- Website established
- Social media presence built
- Brand identity finalized
- Materials designed

**Weeks before launch:**
- Printed materials produced
- Digital campaigns launched
- Outdoor signage placed
- Partner churches notified

**Days before launch:**
- Final social media push
- Personal invitation reminders to Launch Team
- Press releases sent

**Launch Sunday:**
- Video and photography capture
- Social media documentation

**After launch:**
- Follow-up promotion of upcoming services
- Content created from launch footage
- Ongoing promotional rhythm established

## Working with Designers and Vendors

Quality promotion often requires outside help. The Promotion Leader:

- Identifies and vets designers, printers, and other vendors
- Communicates vision clearly to creative partners
- Manages review and approval processes
- Ensures deliverables meet standards
- Stays within budget

<Callout type="warning">
  Poor quality materials reflect poorly on the church. It's better to do fewer things with quality than many things poorly. Invest in good design.
</Callout>

## Measuring Promotional Effectiveness

Track these metrics to evaluate promotion:

- Website traffic and sources
- Social media engagement and growth
- Response to specific campaigns
- "How did you hear about us?" responses from guests
- Cost per visitor acquired

Use this data to adjust future promotional strategies.

---

## Ongoing Promotion Post-Launch

After launch, promotion continues:

- Regular social media presence
- Website updates
- Seasonal promotional campaigns
- Community event promotion
- Ongoing visibility in the community

The Promotion Leader transitions from launch-focused to ongoing marketing rhythm.

Promotion is not worldly marketing—it's helping people find a community where they can encounter Jesus. Getting the word out is part of fulfilling the Great Commission.
