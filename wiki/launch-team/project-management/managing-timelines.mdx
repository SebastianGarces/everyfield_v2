Building a Gantt chart is the first step. Managing it is the ongoing discipline that determines whether your launch succeeds. Plans are only as good as their execution—and execution requires active, intentional management.

This article covers how to keep your timeline on track and respond effectively when things don't go as planned.

## Understanding Critical Pathways

A **critical pathway** is the longest sequence of dependent tasks that determines your minimum project duration. If any task on the critical path is delayed, your launch date is delayed—unless you can compress other tasks on the path.

### Identifying Your Critical Path

Look at your Gantt chart and trace the dependencies:

1. Start from Launch Sunday and work backward
2. For each task, ask: "What must be complete before this?"
3. Follow the chain of dependencies back to today
4. The longest chain is your critical path

For a church launch, the critical path often runs through:

- **Facility acquisition** → Set-up training → Pre-launch services → Launch Sunday
- **Equipment delivery** → Set-up training → Pre-launch services → Launch Sunday
- **Worship Leader recruitment** → Team building → Rehearsals → Launch Sunday

<Callout type="important">
  Tasks on the critical path have zero flexibility. A one-week delay on the critical path means Launch Sunday moves one week—or you find a way to compress something else.
</Callout>

### Float vs. Critical Path

Tasks not on the critical path have **float**—flexibility in when they can occur without affecting the launch date. Understanding float helps you:

- Know which delays are urgent and which are manageable
- Reassign resources from tasks with float to critical path tasks
- Make smart trade-off decisions when problems arise

## Weekly Timeline Management

Effective timeline management isn't a one-time activity. It's a weekly discipline.

### The Weekly Review

Every week, the Launch Coordinator should:

**1. Update Task Status**
- Mark completed tasks as done
- Update progress on in-flight tasks
- Note any tasks that have slipped

**2. Review Upcoming Deadlines**
- What's due this week?
- What's due in the next 2-3 weeks?
- Are the responsible parties aware and on track?

**3. Identify Risks**
- Are any tasks in danger of missing their deadline?
- Are there external dependencies at risk?
- Have circumstances changed since the plan was made?

**4. Communicate**
- Alert ministry leaders to upcoming deadlines
- Escalate risks that need Senior Pastor attention
- Update the team on overall progress

### The Weekly Project Meeting

In addition to the Coordinator's personal review, schedule regular project meetings with key leaders. Keep these focused and efficient:

| Element | Time |
|---------|------|
| Quick wins / celebrations | 5 min |
| Status updates by area | 15 min |
| Discussion of blockers or risks | 10 min |
| Decisions needed | 10 min |
| Action items and owners | 5 min |

<Callout type="tip">
  End every meeting by reviewing action items aloud. Confirm who owns each item and when it's due. This simple practice dramatically improves follow-through.
</Callout>

## When Things Go Wrong

Plans meet reality, and reality often wins. Here's how to respond when tasks slip or circumstances change.

### Assess the Impact

When a task is delayed, immediately ask:

1. **Is this task on the critical path?** If yes, the delay directly affects Launch Sunday unless you act.
2. **How long is the delay?** A one-day slip is different from a one-month slip.
3. **Can the delay be recovered?** Sometimes additional resources or parallel work can compress the timeline.

### Response Options

Depending on the situation, you have several options:

**Compress the critical path**
- Add resources to critical path tasks
- Work in parallel where possible
- Reduce scope (do less, but do it well)

**Adjust the launch date**
- If the delay is significant and can't be absorbed, it's better to adjust early than to launch poorly
- Communicate the change clearly and explain the reasoning

**Accept the risk**
- Sometimes a delay creates risk but doesn't guarantee failure
- Make a conscious decision about acceptable risk levels

**Find workarounds**
- Creative problem-solving can sometimes bypass obstacles
- Ask: "Is there another way to accomplish this goal?"

### Common Delay Scenarios

| Scenario | Typical Response |
|----------|------------------|
| Equipment delivery delayed | Contact vendor for updates; explore alternative suppliers; adjust training schedule |
| Facility falls through | Immediately restart search; consider temporary alternatives; communicate uncertainty |
| Key leader drops out | Recruit replacement; redistribute responsibilities temporarily; delay affected areas |
| Funding shortfall | Prioritize critical purchases; delay nice-to-haves; increase fundraising focus |
| Training attendance poor | Reschedule; offer multiple times; emphasize importance; consider consequences |

<Callout type="warning">
  Don't hide problems or hope they resolve themselves. Early visibility enables early action. The Launch Coordinator's job is to surface issues, not pretend they don't exist.
</Callout>

## Communication Rhythms

Good timeline management requires good communication. Establish clear rhythms:

### With the Senior Pastor

- **Weekly**: Brief status update (15-30 min) covering progress, risks, and decisions needed
- **As needed**: Immediate escalation of critical issues

### With Ministry Leaders

- **Weekly**: Project meeting with all key leaders
- **Bi-weekly or monthly**: One-on-one check-ins on their specific areas
- **As needed**: Proactive reminders about upcoming deadlines

### With the Full Team

- **Monthly**: High-level progress update at Core Group / Launch Team meetings
- **Milestone moments**: Celebration when major checkpoints are reached

## Managing Multiple Tracks

A church launch has many parallel workstreams. Keeping them coordinated requires intentional effort.

### Create Visibility Across Tracks

Ministry leaders naturally focus on their own areas. The Launch Coordinator creates visibility across areas:

- Facilities needs to know when equipment is arriving (for storage planning)
- Children's Ministry needs to know when the facility is secured (for room assignments)
- Promotion needs to know when the website will be ready (for launch materials)

### Regular Cross-Functional Checkpoints

Build moments into your schedule where different tracks explicitly coordinate:

- **Facility walkthrough** with all ministry leaders once the space is secured
- **Set-up day dry run** before equipment fully arrives to plan placement
- **Service run-through** with worship, children's, assimilation, and facilities together

### Dependency Tracking

Maintain a simple list of cross-team dependencies:

| From | To | Dependency | Due Date |
|------|-----|------------|----------|
| Facilities | Worship | Room dimensions for stage planning | March 15 |
| Technology | Promotion | Website live | April 1 |
| Equipment | All | Equipment arrives | April 15 |
| Worship | Children's | Service time confirmed | March 1 |

Review this list weekly and flag anything at risk.

## Signs You're Off Track

Watch for these warning signs that timeline management needs attention:

**Meetings keep slipping** — If project meetings get canceled or postponed, coordination suffers.

**No one knows what's next** — If ministry leaders are surprised by deadlines, communication has broken down.

**The same issues keep appearing** — If problems recur without resolution, follow-through is weak.

**The Senior Pastor is handling details** — If the Senior Pastor is managing logistics instead of the Coordinator, roles are unclear.

**People seem stressed but not productive** — Activity without progress indicates coordination problems.

## The Final Push

As Launch Sunday approaches, timeline management intensifies. The final 4-6 weeks require:

- **Daily** attention to critical path items
- **Increased meeting frequency** (possibly twice weekly)
- **Clear escalation paths** for problems
- **Visible countdown** keeping everyone focused

This is when the discipline of earlier months pays off. If you've managed the timeline well, the final push is intense but manageable. If you haven't, it becomes chaotic and exhausting.

<Callout type="insight">
  The goal of good timeline management isn't to eliminate stress—it's to ensure that Launch Sunday stress comes from the weight of the moment, not from preventable chaos.
</Callout>
