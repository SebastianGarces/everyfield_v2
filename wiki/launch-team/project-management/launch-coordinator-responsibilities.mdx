Good project management is essential to an excellent launch. While the Senior Pastor casts vision and shepherds the team, someone needs to own the details—tracking timelines, coordinating leaders, and ensuring nothing falls through the cracks. That person is the **Launch Coordinator**.

This role is not optional. It's the difference between a chaotic launch and a confident one.

## Why Project Management Matters

Launching a church involves hundreds of moving pieces: equipment purchases, facility negotiations, team training, promotion timelines, and ministry preparations—all converging on a single Sunday. Without disciplined coordination, critical tasks get missed, deadlines slip, and the team arrives at Launch Sunday exhausted and underprepared.

Many Church Plant Senior Pastors lack the gifting or attention to detail for effective project management. This isn't a criticism—it's simply a recognition that vision casting and detail management require different skill sets. The solution isn't to force the Senior Pastor into a role that doesn't fit. The solution is to find someone who thrives in that role.

## The Six Key Functions

The Launch Coordinator has six core responsibilities, each essential to bringing the church launch in on schedule and on budget.

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **OWN** | Own the launch process under the leadership of the Senior Pastor |
| **LEAD** | Lead the project, building a cohesive and coordinated leader team |
| **DEVELOP** | Develop the project timeline, milestones, and critical pathways |
| **MANAGE** | Manage the timeline, informing leaders of deadlines and keeping on schedule |
| **SCHEDULE** | Schedule and chair project meetings to keep key leaders informed and working together |
| **BRING** | Bring the church launch in on schedule and on budget |

Let's unpack each of these.

### OWN the Launch Process

The Launch Coordinator takes personal ownership of the entire launch process—not just individual tasks, but the whole system. When something isn't getting done, it's the Launch Coordinator's responsibility to identify the gap and address it. This ownership operates under the Senior Pastor's leadership, meaning the Coordinator executes the vision rather than setting it.

### LEAD the Project

Building a cohesive leader team requires more than task assignment. It means helping ministry leaders understand how their work connects to everyone else's. The Children's Ministry Leader needs to know what the Facilities Leader is doing. The Worship Leader needs visibility into the Technology Leader's timeline. The Launch Coordinator facilitates this coordination.

### DEVELOP Timeline and Milestones

Before you can manage a project, you need to define it. The Launch Coordinator works with the Senior Pastor and key leaders to develop:

- **The master timeline** — Key dates from now until Launch Sunday and beyond
- **Milestones** — Major checkpoints that must be reached
- **Critical pathways** — Dependencies where one task must complete before another can begin

### MANAGE the Timeline

Once the plan exists, someone must actively manage it. This means:

- Tracking progress against deadlines
- Identifying tasks falling behind schedule
- Proactively communicating with leaders before deadlines arrive
- Adjusting timelines when circumstances require

### SCHEDULE Project Meetings

Regular coordination meetings keep everyone aligned. The Launch Coordinator schedules and chairs these meetings, ensuring they're productive and focused. Good project meetings:

- Start and end on time
- Have clear agendas
- Result in specific action items with owners and due dates
- Surface issues before they become crises

### BRING the Launch In On Schedule and Budget

Ultimately, the Launch Coordinator is accountable for two outcomes: launching on time and staying within budget. This requires balancing urgency with patience, pushing when necessary and adjusting expectations when circumstances demand.

## What to Look For in a Launch Coordinator

Not everyone is suited for this role. When identifying potential Launch Coordinators from your Core Group, look for these qualities:

**Proven project management skills** — Have they successfully managed complex projects before? This could be in professional settings, volunteer organizations, or other contexts where they coordinated multiple people toward a deadline.

**Attention to detail** — Do they naturally notice what's missing? Do they follow up without being asked? Do they remember commitments and deadlines?

**Relational credibility** — Can they lead leaders? The Launch Coordinator needs to hold other ministry leaders accountable. This requires enough relational capital that leaders respect the Coordinator's role.

**Willingness to serve** — The Launch Coordinator serves the Senior Pastor and the team. This isn't a position of authority for its own sake—it's a serving role that enables others to succeed.

**Calm under pressure** — As Launch Sunday approaches, stress increases. You need someone who remains clear-headed when things get hectic.

<Callout type="tip">
  Look for someone who already demonstrates these qualities in how they engage with the Core Group. Past behavior is the best predictor of future performance.

## The Senior Pastor and Launch Coordinator Partnership

The relationship between Senior Pastor and Launch Coordinator is a partnership, not a hierarchy of control. Here's how it should work:

**The Senior Pastor provides:**
- Overall vision and direction
- Final decisions on priorities and trade-offs
- Spiritual leadership of the team
- Authority backing the Coordinator's role

**The Launch Coordinator provides:**
- Detailed planning and execution
- Regular status updates
- Early warning on risks and delays
- Recommendations when decisions are needed

This partnership works best when both parties communicate frequently and trust each other's domain. The Senior Pastor trusts the Coordinator to manage details; the Coordinator trusts the Senior Pastor to provide direction when needed.

## If You Don't Have a Launch Coordinator

What if no one in your Core Group has the skills for this role? You have three options:

1. **Develop yourself** — Recognize that project management is learnable. Discipline yourself to pay attention to detail, use tools consistently, and build habits of follow-through. This is harder for naturally visionary leaders, but it's possible.

2. **Recruit specifically** — Actively look for someone with project management skills to join your Core Group. Consider professionals in operations, event planning, construction, or other detail-oriented fields.

3. **Delay until you find one** — A weak Launch Coordinator can be worse than none at all. If project management is a critical gap, it may be worth extending your timeline until you find the right person.

<Callout type="warning">
  Don't assume project management will "just happen." Without intentional coordination, tasks fall through the cracks and the team arrives at Launch Sunday scrambling to catch up.

## Getting Started

If you've identified your Launch Coordinator, the next step is building your project plan. This starts with developing a Gantt chart that maps out all the work required to launch successfully.

Counting the cost requires knowing what the cost is. The Launch Coordinator helps you see the full picture and ensures nothing is left to chance.
