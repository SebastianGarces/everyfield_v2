Setting a targeted launch date is one of the key milestones in the life of a Core Group. It marks the transition from building and gathering to preparing and launching. Get this decision right, and you set yourself up for momentum. Get it wrong, and you may launch prematurely—or miss a window of opportunity.

Experience shows that assigning a launch date is more art than science. There's no formula that guarantees success, but there are principles that dramatically improve your odds.

## Why the Launch Date Matters

The launch date isn't just a date on the calendar—it's a **forcing function** that transforms how your team operates. Before a launch date is set, the Core Group can feel like a fellowship gathering. After a launch date is set, everything changes.

<Callout type="insight">
  A launch date creates urgency, focus, and accountability. Without it, preparation can drift indefinitely. With it, every decision has a deadline.

### What Changes When You Set a Date

| Before Launch Date | After Launch Date |
|-------------------|------------------|
| Growing the Core Group is primary | Training and preparation become primary |
| Meetings are fellowship-focused | Meetings become task-oriented |
| Timeline is flexible | Timeline is fixed |
| "Someday" thinking | "By this date" thinking |
| Core Group identity | Launch Team identity |

## When to Set Your Launch Date

The timing of this decision is critical. Set it too early, and you'll rush preparation with an underdeveloped team. Set it too late, and you'll lose momentum as people wonder if the church will ever actually launch.

### Signs You're Ready to Set a Date

Before committing to a launch date, evaluate whether these conditions are substantially in place:

- [ ] **Critical mass is building** — You have 30-40 adults with a trajectory toward 50-100
- [ ] **Momentum is growing** — New people are joining regularly, not sporadically
- [ ] **Cohesiveness is developing** — The group functions as a unified team, not just individuals
- [ ] **Financial base is established** — Giving patterns indicate sustainability
- [ ] **Worship leader is identified** — Or strong candidates are in view
- [ ] **Geographic area is clear** — You know where you're planting
- [ ] **Facilities are in sight** — You have a venue or strong possibilities
- [ ] **Training time is adequate** — You have enough runway for thorough preparation

<Callout type="warning">
  Don't let external pressure drive your launch date. A premature launch with an unprepared team is worse than waiting another season.
</Callout>

## The Art of Timing

Setting a launch date requires balancing multiple factors—some quantifiable, others intuitive. Here's how to think through this decision:

### Start with the Season

The best launch seasons are:

1. **Fall (as schools open)** — Families are establishing new routines and open to new commitments
2. **Spring (before Easter)** — Natural momentum toward Easter services brings visitors

Work backward from these windows. If you're targeting a fall launch, you need to set the date 6-9 months in advance to allow adequate preparation time.

### Factor in Preparation Needs

Once you identify a target season, assess whether you have enough time for:

- **Leadership development** — Key roles filled and trained
- **Equipment procurement** — Everything ordered and received
- **Facility preparation** — Venue secured and logistics worked out
- **Ministry team training** — All volunteers ready for their roles
- **Promotional execution** — Full marketing plan implemented

If any of these can't be completed in time, adjust your target date.

### Trust Your Instincts

After weighing the objective factors, listen to what the Spirit is saying. Sometimes the data says wait, but God says go. Other times everything looks ready, but something feels off. Pray, seek counsel, and make the call.

## How to Set the Date

When you're ready to commit, follow this process:

### 1. Consult Your Coach or Mentor

Don't make this decision in isolation. Your coach has seen multiple launches and can help you assess readiness. They may see blind spots or confirm what you're sensing.

### 2. Discuss with Key Leaders

Before announcing to the full Core Group, discuss with your inner circle. Get their input, address concerns, and ensure alignment. You want your key leaders championing this date, not questioning it.

### 3. Pray as a Leadership Team

Set aside time specifically to seek the Lord's direction. This isn't a business decision—it's a ministry milestone. Make sure you've earnestly sought His guidance.

### 4. Announce to the Core Group

When you announce the date, do it with conviction and celebration. This is a milestone worth marking. Cast vision for what Launch Sunday will look like and what needs to happen to get there.

<Callout type="tip">
  When you announce the launch date, also announce the transition from Core Group to Launch Team. This signals that the mission is shifting from gathering to launching.
</Callout>

### 5. Lock It In

Once announced, treat the date as fixed. Don't allow second-guessing or constant renegotiation. The only reason to change a launch date should be a significant unforeseen circumstance—not cold feet or perfectionism.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Launching Too Soon

The pressure to "just get started" is real. But launching before you're ready can mean:

- Thin volunteer teams that burn out quickly
- Underdeveloped systems that create chaos
- Low attendance that discourages rather than energizes
- Financial strain from inadequate giving base

### Waiting Too Long

On the other hand, perpetual preparation can kill momentum:

- Core Group members lose enthusiasm
- The "launch fatigue" sets in
- New people stop joining because nothing ever happens
- You become known as "that church that's always about to launch"

### Picking a Bad Date

Avoid launching on:

- Holiday weekends (Memorial Day, Labor Day, July 4th)
- Super Bowl Sunday
- Dates that conflict with major community events
- Weeks when many families are on vacation

---

## After You Set the Date

Once the launch date is established, everything accelerates. Your focus shifts from "Will we launch?" to "How do we launch well?"

Key next steps include:

1. **Communicate the timeline** — Everyone needs to know the schedule leading up to launch
2. **Assign responsibilities** — Each leader needs clear ownership of their domain
3. **Develop the project plan** — Work backward from launch to identify all milestones
4. **Increase meeting frequency** — Core Group meetings become more frequent and task-focused
5. **Begin countdown communications** — Regular updates build anticipation and accountability
