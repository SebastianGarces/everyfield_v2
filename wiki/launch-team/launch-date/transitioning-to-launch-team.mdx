When the launch date is set, everything changes. The Core Group—focused primarily on growth and community—becomes the Launch Team, focused primarily on preparation and execution. This transition is more than a name change. It's a fundamental shift in mission, rhythm, and expectations.

Understanding this transition helps you lead your team through it with clarity and purpose.

## What Actually Changes

### The Mission Shifts

| Core Group Phase | Launch Team Phase |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Growing the group is primary | Training and preparation are primary |
| "Who else should join us?" | "How do we launch well?" |
| Building community | Building systems |
| Gathering people | Deploying people |
| Vision Meetings are central | Training sessions are central |

<Callout type="insight">
  The Core Group asks, "Who will be part of this?" The Launch Team asks, "How will we do this?" Both questions matter, but the emphasis shifts dramatically.
</Callout>

### Vision Meetings Continue—But Differently

Vision Meetings don't stop when you become a Launch Team. You still want new people joining. But the focus and frequency change:

**Before (Core Group):**
- Vision Meetings every 1-2 weeks
- Primary growth engine
- Everyone's main assignment: invite people

**After (Launch Team):**
- Vision Meetings continue but less frequent
- Now one track among many
- Some team members shift to training focus

Growing the Core Group becomes *secondary* to preparing for launch. This doesn't mean growth stops—it means the team's bandwidth shifts toward execution.

### Meeting Format Transforms

Core Group meetings are designed to **inspire** and **enculturate**. Launch Team meetings add a third objective: **inform**.

| Objective | Core Group | Launch Team |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| **INSPIRE** | Cast vision through worship, devotional, prayer | Continues—vision casting never stops |
| **INSTILL** | Enculturate team in values, distinctives, DNA | Continues—but assumes baseline understanding |
| **INFORM** | Minimal—focus on community | Major focus—training, updates, assignments |

---

## The Three Launch Team Objectives

### 1. Cast Vision (Continue)

Vision casting doesn't stop at the launch date—if anything, it intensifies. As the work gets harder, people need to be reminded *why* they're doing it.

**Vision casting in the Launch Team phase includes:**

- Renewing people's vision of the Living God
- Reminding them why you're planting this church
- Worship, devotional, and prayer remain central
- Updates on what God is doing locally and in the network
- Celebrating wins along the way

### 2. Enculturate Team (Continue)

Values and distinctives must be deeply embedded before launch. A Launch Team that doesn't share DNA will struggle to create consistent culture on Launch Sunday and beyond.

**Enculturation in the Launch Team phase includes:**

- Teaching on the 4 Pillars, Worship/Walk/Work, Ministry Funnel
- Visiting established churches to see values in action
- Attending network training events
- Discussing and internalizing distinctives

<Callout type="tip">
  Visit at least one healthy church in your network before launch. Seeing the model lived out is worth a hundred explanations.
</Callout>

### 3. Train the Team (New Focus)

Training becomes the dominant addition to Launch Team meetings. This is where you prepare every ministry area for execution.

**Training in the Launch Team phase includes:**

| Training Type | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Corporate Training** | Whole-team sessions on philosophy, expectations, Launch Day overview |
| **Ministry Team Training** | Breakout sessions for specific ministries (worship, children's, facilities, etc.) |
| **Outside Training** | Network events, conferences, specialized workshops |
| **Hands-on Observation** | Visits to see other churches in action |

## How Meeting Frequency Changes

As you transition to Launch Team, expect meeting frequency to increase:

### Core Group Phase (Typical)

- **First few months:** Twice per month
- **As group grows:** May increase slightly
- **Focus:** Community building, Vision Meetings

### Launch Team Phase (Typical)

- **6-4 months out:** Weekly Launch Team meetings begin
- **3-2 months out:** May add ministry-specific meetings
- **Final month:** Pre-launch services, intensive preparation

<Callout type="warning">
  Don't peak too early. Increasing meeting frequency too soon leads to Launch Team fatigue before you reach Launch Sunday. Pace the intensity carefully.
</Callout>

## Managing the Transition

### Announce It Clearly

When you set the launch date, explicitly announce the transition:

*"As of today, we are no longer just a Core Group—we are a Launch Team. Our mission is shifting. Growing our numbers is still important, but now our primary focus is preparing to launch this church well on [date]."*

People need to understand that expectations are changing. What was acceptable in the Core Group phase may not be sufficient for the Launch Team phase.

### Expect Some Turnover

The transition sometimes reveals who's truly committed:

- Some people joined for the community but aren't ready for the work
- Some realize the time commitment exceeds what they can give
- Some were excited about "someday" but not about actual deadlines

This is painful but clarifying. Better to know now than on Launch Sunday.

<Callout type="important">
  Losing a few uncommitted people is better than dragging them through the launch. A smaller, fully committed Launch Team outperforms a larger, half-hearted one.
</Callout>

### Assign Specific Roles

In the Core Group phase, everyone had the same assignment: grow the group, pray, give. In the Launch Team phase, people need specific ministry assignments.

**Key leadership roles to fill:**

- Launch Coordinator
- Worship Leader
- Children's Ministry Leader
- Facilities Leader
- Assimilation Leaders
- Small Group Leader
- Promotion Leader
- Technology Leader
- Prayer Leader

Beyond leaders, every Launch Team member should have a serving role for Launch Sunday.

### Increase Communication Clarity

Core Group communication can be informal. Launch Team communication needs to be crisp:

- Clear deadlines, not vague timelines
- Specific assignments, not general appeals
- Regular progress updates
- Written agendas and action items
- Accountability for follow-through

## The Launch Team Meeting Format

A typical Launch Team meeting might follow this structure:

| Segment | Time | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| **Worship & Prayer** | 15-20 min | Inspire—connect with God and each other |
| **Vision Cast** | 5-10 min | Inspire—remind why we're doing this |
| **Updates & Celebration** | 10-15 min | Inform—share progress, celebrate wins |
| **Training Content** | 20-30 min | Inform—corporate or ministry-specific |
| **Ministry Breakouts** | 20-30 min | Inform—teams work on specifics |
| **Closing & Assignments** | 10 min | Inform—clear next steps, prayer |

Adjust based on what phase you're in and what content needs to be covered.

## Common Transition Challenges

### Challenge: People Miss the Old Vibe

The Core Group phase often feels more relational and less task-oriented. Some people will miss that.

**Response:** Acknowledge the shift. Create space for community within the new structure. Remind people that this intensity is temporary—post-launch rhythms will be different.

### Challenge: Leadership Gaps Become Apparent

When you assign specific roles, you may discover gaps. You need a Children's Ministry Leader but don't have one. You need a Launch Coordinator but no one fits.

**Response:** Start recruiting immediately. Pray specifically. Consider whether launch date adjustment is needed if critical roles remain unfilled.

### Challenge: Some People Don't Step Up

In the Core Group, participation was somewhat optional. In the Launch Team, everyone needs to contribute.

**Response:** Have direct conversations. Clarify expectations. Give people the chance to recommit—or graciously release them.

### Challenge: Overwhelm Sets In

The volume of tasks can feel crushing. There's so much to do with finite people and time.

**Response:** Prioritize ruthlessly. Focus on essentials. Trust that imperfect execution with the right heart beats perfect execution that never happens.
