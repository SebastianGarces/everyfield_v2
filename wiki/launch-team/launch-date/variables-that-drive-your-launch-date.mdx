Setting your launch date isn't a single decision—it's the intersection of multiple variables that must align. Understanding each factor helps you assess readiness honestly and set a date with confidence. Some variables are within your control; others require patience and prayer.

## The Eight Key Variables

### 1. Critical Mass of People

**Target: 30-40 adults minimum, with goal of 50-100**

The size of your Core Group is the most visible readiness indicator. But raw numbers don't tell the whole story—you need the *right kind* of people at *sufficient scale*.

| Metric | Minimum | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **Adult count** | 30-40 | 50-100 |
| **Giving units** | 15-20 | 30-50 |
| **Committed families** | 8-12 | 15-25 |
| **Key leaders identified** | 5-6 | 8-10 |

<Callout type="important">
  "Adults" means people who will actively participate—not just names on a list. Count those who attend consistently, give regularly, and are genuinely committed.
</Callout>

**Questions to assess this variable:**

- How many adults have been to at least 3 Core Group gatherings?
- How many are giving financially to the plant?
- How many have signed a commitment card?
- What's the trajectory—growing, plateaued, or declining?

### 2. Momentum in Core Group Growth

**Look for: Consistent growth, not sporadic spikes**

Numbers alone don't indicate readiness—*trajectory* matters as much as totals. A Core Group of 35 that's been stuck for 6 months is less ready than a Core Group of 30 that's added 5 families in the last 2 months.

**Signs of healthy momentum:**

- New people joining from Vision Meetings regularly
- Existing members actively inviting others
- Energy and enthusiasm at gatherings
- Increasing attendance at Core Group meetings
- Growing buzz in the community about the plant

**Warning signs of stalled momentum:**

- Same faces at every gathering for months
- Vision Meetings with few new attendees
- Core Group members not inviting others
- Low energy or declining enthusiasm
- People dropping out faster than joining

<Callout type="tip">
  Track your growth rate over 3-month windows. If you're not adding new people consistently, focus on growth strategies before setting a launch date.
</Callout>

### 3. Cohesiveness in the Core Group

**Look for: Unity, shared vision, genuine community**

A Core Group can have the right numbers but lack the depth needed to weather the intensity of launching. Cohesiveness means people are genuinely unified—not just attending the same meetings.

**Indicators of cohesiveness:**

- Relationships forming outside formal gatherings
- Spontaneous prayer and support for one another
- Alignment on vision, values, and distinctives
- Conflict resolved healthily when it arises
- Shared ownership of the mission (not just following the pastor)

**Questions to assess this variable:**

- Do Core Group members know each other's names and stories?
- Are people meeting outside of organized events?
- Is there genuine enthusiasm or just polite attendance?
- How would the group respond to a significant challenge?

### 4. Financial Base Established

**Look for: Sustainable giving patterns, not just one-time gifts**

Launching a church requires money—for equipment, facilities, promotion, and ongoing operations. The Core Group's giving patterns indicate whether you have the financial foundation to launch well.

| Financial Indicator | What to Look For |
|--------------------|------------------|
| **Regular giving** | Majority of families giving monthly |
| **Giving growth** | Amounts increasing over time |
| **Sacrificial spirit** | Generosity beyond what's comfortable |
| **Financial margin** | Reserves building, not just break-even |
| **Major expenses covered** | Equipment budget within reach |

<Callout type="warning">
  Don't assume finances will "work out" after launch. If giving isn't established in the Core Group phase, it won't magically appear on Launch Sunday.
</Callout>

### 5. Worship Leader Identified

**Look for: Confirmed leader or strong candidates in sight**

Sunday morning worship requires skilled, spiritually mature leadership. This is often one of the hardest positions to fill and shouldn't be left to chance.

**Readiness indicators:**

- Worship Leader identified and committed
- Or 2-3 strong candidates being cultivated
- Musical skill and spiritual maturity both present
- Alignment with your worship philosophy
- Ability to build and lead a team

If you don't have a Worship Leader and don't have strong candidates, this variable alone may drive you to wait. Launching without quality worship leadership significantly handicaps your services.

### 6. Geographic Area Identified

**Look for: Clear target community for your church**

You can't launch "somewhere"—you need a specific place. This affects facilities, promotion, team commutes, and community engagement.

**Questions to clarify:**

- What city/town/neighborhood will you serve?
- Where do your Core Group members live?
- What's the drive time from Core Group members' homes to the target area?
- What demographic will you primarily reach?
- Are there barriers to reaching this community?

### 7. Facilities Found

**Look for: Secured venue or strong possibilities in sight**

You need a place to meet on Sunday mornings. Finding the right facility takes time, negotiation, and often compromise.

| Facility Status | Readiness Level |
|----------------|-----------------|
| **Lease signed** | Green light |
| **Verbal agreement, finalizing terms** | Nearly ready |
| **2-3 strong options being evaluated** | Caution—can move forward but with risk |
| **Still searching** | Not ready—facility search can take months |

**Key facility considerations:**

- Adequate size for launch attendance plus growth
- Availability at needed times (Sunday morning, setup access)
- Reasonable cost relative to budget
- Appropriate location and visibility
- Flexibility for your needs (children's space, setup/teardown)

<Callout type="insight">
  Facility negotiations often take longer than expected. Start early and have backup options. A good rule: begin facility search 9-12 months before target launch.
</Callout>

### 8. Adequate Training Time

**Look for: Sufficient runway for comprehensive preparation**

Launching well requires trained teams across multiple ministries. Rushing training leads to chaos on Launch Sunday and burnout afterward.

**Training needs to cover:**

| Ministry Area | Training Required |
|--------------|-------------------|
| **Worship/Production** | Musical rehearsals, sound/lighting operation |
| **Children's Ministry** | Curriculum, safety protocols, check-in systems |
| **Assimilation** | Guest follow-up processes, data management |
| **Facilities** | Setup/teardown procedures, equipment operation |
| **Hospitality** | Greeting, hosting, guest reception |
| **Small Groups** | Leader training, group launch preparation |

**Minimum training timeline:**

- 3-4 months for ministry-specific training
- 2-3 pre-launch services for integration
- Ongoing training continues after launch

## Assessing Overall Readiness

Use this matrix to evaluate your readiness across all variables:

| Variable | Red (Not Ready) | Yellow (Caution) | Green (Ready) |
|----------|-----------------|------------------|---------------|
| **Critical Mass** | Under 25 adults | 25-40 adults | 40+ adults |
| **Momentum** | Stalled or declining | Slow but steady | Consistent growth |
| **Cohesiveness** | Fragmented, low unity | Developing, some depth | Strong community, shared ownership |
| **Finances** | Minimal giving, no reserves | Adequate giving, tight budget | Strong giving, financial margin |
| **Worship Leader** | No candidates | Possibilities in view | Leader identified and committed |
| **Geography** | Unclear target area | General area identified | Specific community focused |
| **Facilities** | No options | Searching, possibilities exist | Venue secured or nearly finalized |
| **Training Time** | Less than 2 months | 2-4 months | 4+ months |

<Callout type="important">
  You don't need "green" across every variable to set a launch date—but you need to honestly assess yellow and red areas and have a plan to address them before launch.
</Callout>

## When Variables Conflict

Sometimes variables point in different directions. Your Core Group is ready, but facilities aren't secured. Or finances are strong, but you lack a Worship Leader.

**Prioritization framework:**

1. **Non-negotiables** — Must be green or strong yellow before setting date:
   - Critical mass (minimum 30 adults)
   - Facilities (at least strong possibilities)
   - Worship Leader (identified or strong candidates)

2. **Important but workable** — Can be yellow if trending positive:
   - Momentum
   - Cohesiveness
   - Financial base
   - Geographic clarity

3. **Time-dependent** — Can be addressed with adequate runway:
   - Training time (just need enough months)
