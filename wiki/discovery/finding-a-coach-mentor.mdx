The Launch Playbook consistently references working with a "coach"—someone who guides you through the planting process, provides accountability, and shares wisdom from experience. Finding the right mentor is one of the most important things you can do before launching.

You don't have to figure this out alone. In fact, you shouldn't.

## Why Mentors Matter

Church planting is too complex and too important to navigate solo. A good mentor provides:

| Benefit | How It Helps |
|---------|--------------|
| **Wisdom** | Learn from their successes and mistakes |
| **Accountability** | Someone who asks hard questions |
| **Perspective** | Outside view when you're too close to see clearly |
| **Encouragement** | Support during inevitable discouragements |
| **Connections** | Access to their network and relationships |
| **Credibility** | Their endorsement opens doors |

<Callout type="scripture">
  *"Plans fail for lack of counsel, but with many advisers they succeed."* — Proverbs 15:22
</Callout>

The Launch Playbook assumes you have a coach for good reason. Critical decisions—budgeting, facility selection, timeline setting—benefit enormously from experienced input.

## Types of Mentors You Need

Most church planters benefit from multiple mentors serving different roles:

### Primary Coach

Your main accountability relationship throughout the planting process. This person:
- Meets with you regularly (weekly or bi-weekly)
- Knows the details of your plant
- Provides ongoing guidance and accountability
- Helps with major decisions
- Often comes through your network or sending church

### Experienced Planter

Someone who has successfully planted a church and can speak from direct experience:
- Understands the emotional journey
- Can share practical lessons learned
- Validates your struggles as normal
- Provides hope that it's possible

### Life Mentor

Someone who invests in you as a person, not just as a planter:
- Focuses on character and spiritual health
- Helps with marriage and family priorities
- Provides perspective beyond ministry
- May not have church planting experience

### Specialized Advisors

People with expertise in specific areas:
- Financial management
- Legal and organizational setup
- Marketing and communications
- Leadership development

<Callout type="tip">
  Don't expect one person to fill all these roles. Build a team of mentors who collectively provide what you need.
</Callout>

## How to Find a Mentor

Mentors rarely appear automatically. You'll need to be intentional.

### Observe People Around You

Start by looking at who's already in your life:
- Church leaders you respect
- Successful planters in your network
- Business leaders in your congregation or community
- Older believers whose character you admire

Good mentors are often closer than you think. The godly businessperson at your gym, the experienced pastor at a partner church, the leader in your network who has planted before—they're all potential mentors.

<Callout type="insight">
  Not every mentor needs to be a pastor. Some of the best leadership and life principles come from godly people in business, nonprofit leadership, or other fields. Look for high character and proven wisdom, not just ministry credentials.
</Callout>

### Look for Specific Qualities

When evaluating potential mentors, consider:

| Quality | Why It Matters |
|---------|----------------|
| **Character** | High integrity and godly behavior |
| **Experience** | Relevant knowledge to share |
| **Availability** | Actually able to meet with you |
| **Chemistry** | Natural connection and comfort |
| **Honesty** | Willing to tell you hard truths |
| **Humility** | Not trying to create a clone of themselves |

### Ask People You Respect

Talk to:
- Your sending church leadership
- Your denomination or network leaders
- Other church planters
- Seminary professors or ministry trainers

Ask: "Who do you know that might be able to mentor me through this process?"

### Leverage Your Network

If you're planting through a network or denomination:
- Ask about formal coaching programs
- Request mentor recommendations
- Attend network events to meet potential mentors
- Ask other planters who mentored them

## Making the Ask

Many people hesitate to ask someone to mentor them. Don't. Most experienced leaders are honored to be asked and willing to invest if approached well.

### Be Specific About What You're Asking

Don't ask vaguely for "mentoring." Be clear:
- How often you'd like to meet
- What you're hoping to learn
- What time commitment you're requesting
- How long you envision the relationship lasting

### Make It Easy to Say Yes

- Suggest meeting at their convenience
- Come prepared with questions
- Take responsibility for scheduling
- Respect their time constraints

### Be Honest About Why You Chose Them

Tell them specifically what you've observed that made you ask them:
- "I've watched how you lead with both strength and humility"
- "Your church plant has thrived, and I want to learn from your experience"
- "I've seen how you balance ministry and family well"

People respond to genuine, specific appreciation.

### Give Them an Out

Make it easy to decline without awkwardness:
- "I understand if your schedule doesn't allow for this"
- "Even if ongoing mentoring doesn't work, could we meet once for your input?"
- "If this isn't the right fit, could you recommend someone else?"

## Getting the Most from Mentoring

Once you have a mentor, maximize the relationship:

### Come Prepared

Do the work to make meetings productive:
- Have specific questions written down
- Share updates concisely
- Bring real challenges you're facing
- Take notes on their input

### Take Initiative

Don't wait for your mentor to lead:
- Schedule the meetings
- Set the agenda
- Follow up on action items
- Report back on how you applied their advice

### Apply What You Learn

Mentoring is wasted if you don't act on it:
- Implement their suggestions
- Try their recommended approaches
- Report back on results
- Ask follow-up questions

### Be Honest

Don't hide struggles to look good:
- Share real challenges
- Admit mistakes and failures
- Ask for help with hard situations
- Be vulnerable about fears and doubts

<Callout type="warning">
  If you only share successes, you'll only get congratulations. Mentors can only help with problems they know about.
</Callout>

### Express Gratitude

Mentors invest without compensation. Show appreciation:
- Thank them regularly
- Tell them how their input helped
- Update them on wins
- Acknowledge their investment publicly when appropriate

## The 5 A's of Effective Mentoring

Research on effective mentoring relationships identifies five key elements:

### 1. Affinity

There must be natural connection between mentor and mentee. You should genuinely like each other and be drawn to spend time together. Without affinity, meetings become obligations rather than opportunities.

### 2. Availability

Both parties must have time to invest. A brilliant mentor who never has time to meet isn't actually a mentor. Be realistic about schedules on both sides.

### 3. Adaptability

Good mentoring adapts to what the mentee needs in each season. Sometimes you need tough accountability. Other times you need encouragement. A good mentor reads the situation and adjusts.

### 4. Attentiveness

Mentoring requires active listening. The mentor shouldn't do all the talking. Good mentors ask questions, listen carefully, and help you process your own experiences.

### 5. Activation

The goal of mentoring is action, not just conversation. A good mentor activates your gifts, sends you out to lead, and lets go of control. You're not trying to become a clone of your mentor.

## When to Move On

Mentoring relationships don't have to last forever:

- **Seasonal mentoring** — A mentor for a specific challenge or season
- **Transitional mentoring** — As you grow, you may need different input
- **Completion** — Some relationships naturally conclude

Moving on from a mentor isn't failure—it's often a sign of growth. Maintain the relationship even if formal mentoring ends.

Don't plant alone. Find mentors who will walk with you, challenge you, and help you become the leader your church needs. The investment in these relationships will pay dividends throughout your ministry.
