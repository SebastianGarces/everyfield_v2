*/}

Beyond your foundational pillars, every church develops a set of values, distinctives, and DNA that shape its culture. These aren't abstract concepts—they're the lived reality of who you are and how you operate.

Defining these clearly before you launch sets the trajectory for everything that follows.

## Pillars vs. Values vs. Distinctives

These terms are related but distinct:

| Term | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Pillars** | Fundamental, non-negotiable biblical commitments | "We are committed to the authority of Scripture" |
| **Values** | How you prioritize and operate | "We value excellence in everything we do" |
| **Distinctives** | What makes you unique compared to other churches | "We emphasize expository preaching through books of the Bible" |
| **DNA** | The embedded culture that shapes behavior | "We're a church that celebrates publicly and cares privately" |

Your pillars are load-bearing walls. Values, distinctives, and DNA are the interior design—how the space feels and functions.

<Callout type="insight">
  Pillars answer "What do we believe?" Values answer "How do we operate?" Distinctives answer "What makes us unique?"

## Why Values Matter

Values guide behavior when no one is watching and when policies don't apply. They shape:

- **How decisions get made** — What factors carry the most weight?
- **How people are treated** — What does respect and care look like here?
- **How conflict is handled** — What's acceptable and unacceptable?
- **How excellence is defined** — What standard are we aiming for?
- **How newcomers are welcomed** — What's the first impression?

Unclear values lead to inconsistent behavior. People don't know what's expected, and leaders make contradictory decisions.

## Common Church Values

Here are values that healthy churches often embrace. Use these as a starting point for identifying your own:

### Ministry Values

| Value | What It Means |
|-------|---------------|
| **Biblical fidelity** | Scripture shapes everything we do |
| **Excellence** | We give our best in all things |
| **Authenticity** | We're real about struggles and growth |
| **Accessibility** | We remove barriers for newcomers |
| **Multiplication** | We exist to reproduce, not just grow |

### Relational Values

| Value | What It Means |
|-------|---------------|
| **Community** | Relationships matter more than programs |
| **Hospitality** | Guests feel genuinely welcomed |
| **Transparency** | Leaders are open and honest |
| **Unity** | We pursue harmony and resolve conflict |
| **Care** | We shepherd people, not just manage them |

### Operational Values

| Value | What It Means |
|-------|---------------|
| **Stewardship** | We manage resources responsibly |
| **Simplicity** | We avoid unnecessary complexity |
| **Flexibility** | We adapt methods while holding convictions |
| **Accountability** | We hold each other to commitments |
| **Planning** | We prepare thoroughly, not haphazardly |

## Process for Defining Your Values

### Step 1: Reflect on What Matters Most

Start with these questions:

- What do you want people to experience when they encounter your church?
- What behaviors do you want to characterize your community?
- What would make you say "That's not who we are"?
- What patterns from healthy churches do you want to replicate?
- What mistakes from unhealthy churches do you want to avoid?

Write freely. Don't edit yet.

### Step 2: Identify Patterns

Review what you've written and look for themes. Group similar ideas together. You're looking for the core commitments that keep appearing.

### Step 3: Prioritize Ruthlessly

You can't emphasize everything equally. Choose 5-7 values that are most important. These should be:

- **Genuine** — You actually believe and practice them
- **Specific** — Clear enough to guide behavior
- **Memorable** — Easy to recall and communicate
- **Distinctive** — Not generic statements everyone would claim

<Callout type="warning">
  Avoid values so generic they're meaningless. Every church claims to "love people" and "follow Jesus." What specifically characterizes how you do this?
</Callout>

### Step 4: Define Each Value Clearly

For each value, write:

1. **A concise statement** — One sentence capturing the value
2. **What it means** — Explanation in plain language
3. **What it looks like** — Concrete examples of the value in action
4. **What it doesn't mean** — Clarifying boundaries and misconceptions

### Step 5: Test Against Reality

Ask honest questions:

- Do I actually live this value, or just aspire to it?
- Would people who know me recognize this in my leadership?
- Is this realistic for our context and resources?
- Will this still be true in 10 years?

If a value is aspirational rather than actual, either commit to changing or acknowledge it's a goal, not a current reality.

## Defining Your Distinctives

Distinctives are what make your church different from the church down the street. They answer: "If someone visited both churches, what would they notice that's unique about us?"

### Categories of Distinctives

**Theological distinctives:**
- Denominational affiliation or independence
- Specific doctrinal emphases
- Approach to controversial issues

**Methodological distinctives:**
- Preaching style (expository, topical, narrative)
- Worship style (traditional, contemporary, blended)
- Service format and length

**Cultural distinctives:**
- Formality level
- Demographic focus
- Neighborhood engagement approach

**Programmatic distinctives:**
- Small group model
- Discipleship pathway
- Missional commitments

<Callout type="tip">
  Your distinctives should be honest, not aspirational. Describe what you actually are and do, not what you wish you were.
</Callout>

## Embedding Values in DNA

Values on paper aren't the same as values in practice. To embed values into your church's DNA:

### Model Them Consistently

People watch leaders more than they listen to them. If you value excellence but are consistently unprepared, your stated value is meaningless.

### Talk About Them Regularly

Reference values in:
- Teaching and preaching
- Leadership meetings
- Decision explanations
- Celebration and correction

### Hire and Recruit for Them

When adding staff or key volunteers, evaluate candidates against your values. Skills can be developed; values alignment is harder to change.

### Correct Violations Promptly

When behavior contradicts stated values, address it. Silence communicates that the values aren't really important.

### Celebrate Examples

When someone embodies a value well, point it out publicly. Stories of values in action teach better than statements.

## Teaching Values to Your Core Group

Your Core Group must understand and embrace your values deeply. They'll carry these into every interaction and ministry.

**In Vision Meetings:**
- Introduce values as part of the presentation
- Explain why each one matters
- Give examples of what they look like

**In Core Group Meetings:**
- Reinforce values through teaching and devotions
- Point out when values are being lived out
- Address when values are being violated

**In One-on-One Conversations:**
- Discuss how values apply to specific situations
- Coach people in living out the values
- Address concerns or misunderstandings

<Callout type="important">
  The goal isn't that people can recite your values. It's that they instinctively live them without thinking about it.
</Callout>

## Values Document Template

Consider creating a simple document that captures your values:

```
OUR VALUES

1. [VALUE NAME]
   We believe... [concise statement]
   This means... [explanation]
   This looks like... [examples]

2. [VALUE NAME]
   We believe... [concise statement]
   This means... [explanation]
   This looks like... [examples]

[Continue for each value]
```

Keep it simple. One page is ideal. Make it something people can actually read and remember.

Your values shape your culture. Your culture shapes your impact. Take time to define clearly what you stand for and how you operate. The clarity you establish now will guide your church for years to come.
