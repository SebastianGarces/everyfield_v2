Before diving into the mechanics of church planting, you must answer a fundamental question: Is this what God has called you to do?

Planting a church is a high calling. It requires **much faith**, **much work**, and **much perseverance**. It is a supernatural work of Jesus building His church (Matt. 16:18), and we have the tremendous privilege of partnering with Him in this work. But not everyone is called to this particular form of ministry.

## The Weight of the Calling

Church planting isn't a career move or a way to escape a difficult ministry situation. It's a divine assignment that will cost you more than you can imagine—and reward you more than you could hope.

  Church planting is not for those looking for an easier path. It's often harder, lonelier, and more demanding than established church ministry.

### What Church Planting Requires

The Launch Playbook makes clear that successful church planting demands:

- **Much faith** — You'll face situations where only God can make a way
- **Much work** — The hours are long and the tasks are endless
- **Much perseverance** — Setbacks, disappointments, and discouragement are guaranteed

If any of these requirements gives you pause, that's not necessarily disqualifying—but it should prompt serious reflection.

## Questions to Discern Your Calling

### Spiritual Questions

**Is there an internal compulsion?**

A calling is more than interest or excitement. It's a deep, persistent sense that you *must* do this—that you won't be fully obedient to God if you don't. This compulsion survives discouragement, criticism, and doubt.

**Have others affirmed this calling?**

God rarely calls in isolation. Has your spouse affirmed this direction? Your pastor? Mature believers who know you well? If those closest to you consistently express concern, pay attention.

**Are you running toward something or away from something?**

Church planting should be a response to a positive calling, not an escape from a difficult situation. If you're frustrated with your current church or leadership, that's not a sufficient reason to plant.

### Character Questions

**Can you handle ambiguity and uncertainty?**

Church planting involves constant unknowns—where you'll meet, who will come, how you'll fund it, what challenges will arise. If you need predictability to thrive, this will be difficult.

**How do you respond to criticism and rejection?**

You will be criticized. People will leave. Some will actively oppose you. Your response to these realities reveals whether you have the resilience church planting requires.

**Are you teachable?**

Church planters who think they have all the answers rarely succeed. The best planters are hungry learners who seek wisdom from mentors, coaches, and predecessors.

<Callout type="tip">
  Ask three people who know you well to honestly assess your readiness. Give them permission to be candid—even if it's uncomfortable to hear.
</Callout>

### Practical Questions

**Is your family prepared for this?**

Church planting affects your entire household. Your spouse must be fully supportive—not just tolerant. If you have children, consider the impact on their stability, friendships, and church experience.

**Are you financially prepared for sacrifice?**

Most church planters experience significant financial pressure, especially in the early years. Some go without salary. Others take substantial pay cuts. Is your family prepared for this reality?

**Do you have the necessary skills—or access to them?**

Effective church planters need a combination of gifts: teaching, leadership, evangelism, administration, and pastoral care. You don't need all of these personally, but you need access to them through your team.

## Signs That Point Toward Calling

While every situation is unique, these indicators often accompany a genuine calling to church planting:

| Indicator | What It Looks Like |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Persistent burden** | The desire doesn't fade with time or difficulty |
| **External affirmation** | Others consistently recognize leadership gifts |
| **Evangelistic fruit** | Track record of leading people to faith |
| **Leadership emergence** | People naturally follow and respond to your leadership |
| **Resilience under pressure** | You bounce back from setbacks rather than being crushed |
| **Alignment of circumstances** | Doors open, resources appear, people emerge |

## Signs That Suggest Waiting

Not every season is right for church planting, even if the calling is genuine:

- **Unresolved character issues** — Deal with these before planting
- **Marriage or family instability** — Shore up your foundation first
- **Lack of ministry experience** — Gain experience under another leader
- **No external affirmation** — Seek input from trusted voices
- **Running from problems** — Address current challenges first
- **Financial crisis** — Stabilize before adding the pressure of planting

<Callout type="warning">
  Planting a church will amplify existing weaknesses, not fix them. Address character issues and relational problems before you plant.
</Callout>

## The Role of Your Sending Church

If you're part of a church network or have a sending church, their affirmation matters significantly. They know you, have observed your ministry, and can speak to your readiness.

Churches that plant churches well typically have:

- A formal assessment process for potential planters
- Coaching and mentoring relationships
- Financial and relational support structures
- Accountability throughout the planting process

If your church or network doesn't affirm your readiness, take that seriously. They may see blind spots you can't.

## What If You're Unsure?

Uncertainty isn't disqualifying. Most church planters experience seasons of doubt. Consider these steps:

1. **Pray persistently** — Ask God to clarify your calling
2. **Seek counsel** — Talk with experienced church planters and mentors
3. **Get assessed** — Many networks offer formal assessment processes
4. **Serve faithfully** — Continue serving where you are while discerning
5. **Wait actively** — Preparation during uncertainty is never wasted

The goal isn't certainty—it's faithfulness. Move forward as God makes the path clear.

Jesus builds His church. If He's calling you to partner with Him in planting, He will provide what you need. Your job is to discern, prepare, and obey.
