*/}

Before you launch, you need a clear picture of what you're aiming for. Vague aspirations like "plant a healthy church" don't provide enough direction. Specific, measurable goals give your team something concrete to work toward.

## Primary Launch Objectives

The Launch Playbook establishes two overarching objectives for church planting:

### Objective 1: Launch with a Mature Core

**Launch the church with a cohesive, mature group of 50-100 adult believers fully aligned with the vision, mission, and distinctives.**

This isn't just about numbers—it's about quality. You need people who are:
- **Cohesive** — Unified and working together
- **Mature** — Spiritually developed and stable
- **Aligned** — Embracing your vision, mission, and distinctives

<Callout type="important">
  50 is the minimum. 100 is the target. Below 50 adults, you're likely underpowered for a sustainable launch. Every person is critical, and normal attrition can create crisis.
</Callout>

### Objective 2: Execute the Ministry Model

**Launch the church in such a way that it can bear fruit quickly by fully executing the ministry model for discipleship (ministry funnel).**

You're not just starting services—you're launching a disciple-making system. The [Worship/Walk/Work/Witness model](/wiki/discovery/the-worship-walk-work-witness-model) should be operational from day one, not something you'll "get to eventually."

## The 8 Key Objectives

The Launch Playbook identifies 8 specific objectives to accomplish before launch:

| # | Objective | Description |
|---|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | **Launch Team Size** | Grow to 50-100 adult believers prior to launch |
| 2 | **Facilities Secured** | Worship services, office space, and storage confirmed |
| 3 | **High Impact Service** | Service and ministry funnel ready to execute |
| 4 | **Finances in Place** | Budget funded; financial processes established |
| 5 | **Equipment Purchased** | All necessary equipment acquired and tested |
| 6 | **Training Completed** | Key responsibilities trained and ready |
| 7 | **Promotion Executed** | Community awareness campaign completed |
| 8 | **Ministry Teams Established** | Teams formed, trained, and ready to serve |

### Breaking Down Each Objective

**1. Launch Team Size (50-100 adults)**

This is your critical mass goal. Track your progress throughout the Core Group development phase:

| Core Group Size | Status |
|----------------|--------|
| Under 30 | High risk—keep growing |
| 30-50 | Minimum viable—proceed with caution |
| 50-75 | Solid foundation—good position |
| 75-100 | Strong—positioned for growth |
| 100+ | Excellent—ready to launch strong |

**2. Facilities Secured**

You need three types of space:
- **Worship facility** — Where you'll hold Sunday services
- **Office space** — Where ministry administration happens
- **Storage** — Where equipment is kept between services

Start the search early. Finding the right facility takes longer than expected.

**3. High Impact Service**

Your first service sets expectations. Plan for:
- Excellent worship experience
- Clear, compelling message
- Smooth children's ministry
- Effective guest assimilation
- Professional-level execution

**4. Finances in Place**

Before launch, establish:
- Operating budget for first year
- Financial reserves (3-6 months recommended)
- Giving processes and systems
- Financial accountability structures

**5. Equipment Purchased**

Major categories include:
- Sound system
- Video/projection
- Lighting
- Staging and signage
- Children's ministry supplies
- Hospitality equipment

**6. Training Completed**

Key areas requiring training:
- Ministry philosophy and values
- Role-specific responsibilities
- Technical skills (sound, video, etc.)
- Guest assimilation processes
- Safety and security protocols

**7. Promotion Executed**

Get the word out through:
- Personal invitations (most effective)
- Social media presence
- Community advertising
- Direct mail (if appropriate)
- Partner church announcements

**8. Ministry Teams Established**

Form teams for each major area:
- Worship and production
- Children's ministry
- Guest services and assimilation
- Small groups
- Facilities and setup
- Administration and finance
- Promotion and communications
- Technology
- Prayer

## Ministry Teams to Establish

The Launch Playbook specifically identifies these teams to have operational by launch:

| Team | Primary Responsibility |
|------|----------------------|
| **Worship Leader and Team** | Leading corporate worship |
| **Children's Ministry** | Safe, engaging children's experiences |
| **Assimilation** | Guest follow-up and integration |
| **Small Groups** | Community and discipleship structure |
| **Administration/Finance** | Financial management and operations |
| **Facilities** | Setup, teardown, and facility care |
| **Promotion** | Marketing and community awareness |
| **Technology** | Website, systems, and technical support |

<Callout type="tip">
  You don't need large teams—you need competent leaders. In many cases, a leader with 2-3 volunteers is sufficient for launch. Teams grow after launch as the church grows.
</Callout>

## Setting Your Personal Goals

Beyond organizational objectives, establish personal goals for yourself as the planter:

### Spiritual Goals

- Daily prayer and Scripture engagement
- Weekly Sabbath rest
- Regular time with a mentor or coach
- Specific areas of character growth

### Relational Goals

- Protected family time
- Investment in Core Group relationships
- Building relationships outside the church plant
- Maintaining existing friendships

### Leadership Goals

- Skills to develop
- Books to read
- Training to complete
- Habits to establish

<Callout type="warning">
  Church planters often sacrifice personal health for ministry progress. Don't do this. A burned-out planter hurts the church more than a delayed launch.
</Callout>

## Making Goals SMART

Effective goals are SMART:

| Element | Question | Example |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **Specific** | What exactly will you accomplish? | "Recruit 60 adults for Core Group" |
| **Measurable** | How will you know you've achieved it? | "Track weekly attendance" |
| **Achievable** | Is this realistic? | "Based on network size and timeline" |
| **Relevant** | Does this matter for the mission? | "Critical mass enables launch" |
| **Time-bound** | When will this be complete? | "By March 1st" |

Convert vague goals into SMART goals:

| Vague Goal | SMART Goal |
|------------|------------|
| "Build a Core Group" | "Recruit and develop 75 committed adults by June 1st" |
| "Raise money" | "Secure $50,000 in committed monthly giving by launch date" |
| "Find a facility" | "Sign facility agreement by April 15th" |
| "Train the team" | "Complete Peak Performance training for all ministry leaders by August 1st" |

## Tracking Progress

Goals mean nothing without accountability. Establish systems to track progress:

### Weekly Review

Each week, assess:
- Core Group attendance and growth
- Giving totals and trends
- Key milestones approaching
- Obstacles or concerns

### Monthly Reporting

Monthly, report to your coach, elders, or accountability partners:
- Progress against each objective
- Wins and celebrations
- Challenges and needs
- Adjustments to plans

### Milestone Celebrations

When you hit key milestones, celebrate! This:
- Encourages the team
- Builds momentum
- Reinforces progress
- Creates memories

Clear goals provide direction. Measured progress provides motivation. Set your targets, track your progress, and adjust as you learn. God honors faithful planning even as He sovereignly directs your steps.
