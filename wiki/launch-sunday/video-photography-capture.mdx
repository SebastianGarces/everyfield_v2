Launch Sunday is a day of celebration and remembrance. Give good thought to capturing the day so it can be remembered frequently and God glorified.

Many great launches have failed to adequately record this important day—to their lasting regret. Don't let this happen to you. Plan now for intentional documentation of everything God does on Launch Sunday.

## Why Capture Matters

Quality photos and video from Launch Sunday serve multiple purposes long after the day is over:

### Memory and History

Years from now, your congregation will want to look back at where it all began. Launch Sunday photos become treasured artifacts that tell the story of God's faithfulness.

### Celebration and Testimony

Share highlights with partners, supporters, and sending churches. Help them celebrate what their prayers and investments made possible.

### Promotion and Outreach

Launch footage becomes content for your website, social media, and future promotional materials. Authentic images of real people in worship are far more compelling than stock photos.

### Encouragement

In difficult seasons ahead (and they will come), Launch Sunday footage reminds your team why you started and what God has already accomplished.

  make in documentation now pays dividends for years to come.

## Assigning the Role

The person capturing photos and video should be **dedicated to that task**—not serving in another ministry role simultaneously.

### Option 1: Recruit a Skilled Volunteer

Look within your Launch Team or network for someone with photography or videography skills. They may have their own equipment and know how to use it well.

### Option 2: Hire a Professional

Consider hiring a professional photographer for Launch Sunday. The investment is minimal compared to the value of quality footage. Get references and review their portfolio.

### Option 3: Multiple Volunteers

Assign several people with smartphones to capture different areas. One person covers setup, another covers the service, another covers fellowship. Collect all footage centrally.

<Callout type="tip">
  If using volunteers with smartphones, ask them to shoot in landscape 
  orientation and avoid using flash during the service.

## Capturing Video Effectively

### Service Recording

If you want a full recording of the service:
- Position a camera at the back center of the room
- Use a tripod for stability
- Connect to the soundboard for quality audio
- Monitor the recording throughout the service

### Highlight Footage

For promotional highlights:
- Capture multiple short clips rather than one long take
- Get variety: wide shots, medium shots, close-ups
- Capture natural moments, not just staged ones
- Record ambient audio for authenticity

### Interview Content

Consider brief interviews with:
- The Senior Pastor sharing the vision
- Launch Team members sharing why they're involved
- First-time guests sharing their experience (with permission)

## Photo Guidelines

### Technical Tips

- Shoot in RAW format if possible for editing flexibility
- Use a fast lens for low-light indoor conditions
- Pay attention to composition and framing
- Capture candid moments, not just posed shots
- Take more photos than you think you need

### Worship Photography Etiquette

- Avoid flash during worship and message
- Position yourself to capture without blocking views
- Be sensitive to emotional moments

### People Photos

- Get a variety of ages and demographics
- Capture genuine expressions and interactions
- Be mindful of who may not want to be photographed
- Focus on people, not just the building

## After Launch Sunday

### Immediate Steps

1. **Backup all footage** — Copy to at least two locations immediately
2. **Review and organize** — Sort through photos and video
3. **Select the best** — Choose the strongest images and clips
4. **Basic editing** — Crop, color correct, and trim as needed

### Short-term Use

- Share select photos with the Launch Team
- Post highlights on social media
- Send to partner organizations and supporters
- Add to website

### Long-term Preservation

- Create a master archive of all footage
- Label and organize by category
- Store in multiple locations (cloud + physical)
- Create a highlight video for future use

<Callout type="warning">
  Don't wait to back up your footage. Memory cards fail, and you 
  can't recreate Launch Sunday. Back up immediately.

## Usage and Permissions

### General Permission

Consider having a general media release in your registration or connection card process. This simplifies future use of photos and video.

### Sensitive Situations

Be aware that some guests may not want to be photographed for various reasons. Respect requests to not be included in photos.

### Children's Photos

Be especially careful with children's photos. Many churches have policies about photographing minors. Follow your children's ministry protocols.
