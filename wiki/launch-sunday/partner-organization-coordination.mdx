You didn't plant this church alone. Your sending organization, partner network, and supporting churches have invested in your success through prayer, resources, and guidance. Launch Sunday is an opportunity to honor those relationships and connect your new congregation to the broader body of Christ.

This article covers two key coordination points: announcements in partner churches and participation in your Launch Sunday service.

## Partner Church Announcements

The week prior to Launch Sunday, an announcement about your launch should go to every partner church in your network. This powerful connection reminds everyone of God's great plans and mercy.

### Why This Matters

Partner church announcements:
- **Unite the network** — Connect your new church to a broader movement
- **Generate prayer** — Mobilize prayer support across multiple congregations
- **Celebrate together** — Let partners share in the joy of launch
- **Model multiplication** — Demonstrate the church planting vision to other churches

### What to Prepare

Create an announcement package that's easy for partner churches to use:

**Announcement Slide**
- Quality photo of the Senior Pastor and family
- Church name and location
- Launch Sunday date and time
- Brief tagline or vision statement

**Email for Church Leaders**
- Brief introduction to your church plant
- Specific prayer requests for Launch Sunday
- How they can share with their congregation
- Your contact information for follow-up

**Bulletin Insert (Optional)**
- Condensed version of the announcement
- Can be printed and distributed

**Social Media Graphics**
- Sized for Facebook, Instagram, etc.
- Easy for partners to share on their channels

<Callout type="tip">
  Make it easy for partner churches to share. Provide announcements in 
  multiple formats so they can use whatever fits their communication style.
</Callout>

### Timeline for Announcements

| Timeframe | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| 3-4 weeks before | Compile list of partner church contacts |
| 2-3 weeks before | Create announcement materials |
| 1 week before | Send announcement package to all partners |
| Launch Sunday | Partners make announcement in their services |
| Week after | Send thank-you with launch highlights |

### Sample Announcement Email

```
Subject: [Church Name] Launches This Sunday!

first public service in [city/community].

## Partner Participation in the Service

Coordinate with your sending organization or partner network about their role in your Launch Sunday service. This honors the relationship and makes the connection visible to your new congregation.

### If a Partner Representative Attends

Having a senior leader from your sending organization present adds weight to Launch Sunday and demonstrates the broader network connection.

**Coordination Steps:**

1. Invite key partners well in advance (6-8 weeks)
2. Confirm who will attend and their role
3. Arrange accommodations if traveling
4. Brief them on the service flow
5. Prepare a proper introduction

**Potential Roles:**

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Greeting | Brief welcome to the congregation |
| Prayer | Prayer of blessing over the church |
| Commissioning | Formal commissioning of the pastor/church |
| Testimony | Sharing about the church planting vision |
| Closing | Benediction or final words |

**Introduction Guidelines:**

- Keep the introduction warm but brief
- Highlight the relationship and investment
- Allow 3-5 minutes maximum for their participation
- Place appropriately in the service flow (often before or after the message)

<Callout type="important">
  Coordinate the specific content and timing in advance. You don't want 
  surprises during the service that throw off your flow.
</Callout>

### If No One Can Attend

When a partner representative can't be physically present, there are still meaningful ways to include them:

**Video Greeting**
- Request a brief video message (2-3 minutes)
- They can share encouragement and pray for your church
- Play during announcements or as part of the service

**Letter of Blessing**
- Read a letter from network leadership
- Excerpt key portions if the full letter is long
- Display the letter visually while reading

**Acknowledgment Slide**
- Display a slide acknowledging your sending organization
- Include their logo and a brief statement of partnership
- The Senior Pastor can verbally acknowledge the relationship

**Network Story**
- Share briefly about the network and your connection
- Explain how their support made the launch possible
- Cast vision for future multiplication

### Coordination Checklist

- [ ] Contact partner organization 6-8 weeks before launch
- [ ] Discuss preferred participation options
- [ ] Confirm attendance or alternative participation
- [ ] Request any needed materials (video, letter, etc.)
- [ ] Receive and review materials at least 1 week before
- [ ] Prepare introduction and service flow integration
- [ ] Test any video or technical elements
- [ ] Brief the partner representative on logistics
- [ ] Thank partners publicly during the service
- [ ] Follow up with gratitude after launch

## Honoring the Relationship

The way you handle partner coordination on Launch Sunday sets the tone for ongoing relationship. Do it well, and you strengthen ties that benefit your church for years.

### Public Acknowledgment

During the service, publicly thank your sending organization and partners. Be specific about how they helped make the launch possible. This models gratitude and helps your congregation understand they're part of something bigger.

### Private Gratitude

Send personal thank-you notes to key partners within a week of launch. Include:
- Specific attendance numbers and highlights
- Stories of what God did
- Ongoing prayer requests
- Your gratitude for their investment

### Ongoing Connection

Launch Sunday isn't the end of the partnership. Maintain regular communication:
- Share monthly updates with key partners
- Participate in network gatherings
- Fulfill any reporting commitments
- Look for ways to give back to the network
