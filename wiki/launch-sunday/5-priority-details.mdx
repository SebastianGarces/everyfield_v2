As the historic day arrives, several details need special attention. While your team has trained for months, these five priority areas require intentional focus to execute Launch Sunday with excellence.

## 1. Checklists Prepared and Implemented

Every key ministry leader should develop Sunday morning checklists with their team. While prepared for Launch Sunday, these checklists become the foundation for every subsequent Sunday.

### Why Checklists Matter

Checklists ensure:
- **Consistency** — The same tasks get done the same way every week
- **Accountability** — Team members know exactly what they're responsible for
- **Quality** — Nothing important gets overlooked
- **Training** — New volunteers can step into roles quickly

<Callout type="important">
  Checklists are not optional. They are essential tools that transform 
  well-intentioned volunteers into effective ministry teams.
</Callout>

### Checklists to Develop

| Ministry Area | Key Checklist Items |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Set-up/Tear-down | Equipment staging, room configuration, storage |
| Signage and Parking | Sign placement, traffic flow, volunteer positions |
| Facility | Room prep, cleanliness, HVAC, lighting |
| Greeters/Ushers | Position assignments, greeting scripts, offering procedures |
| Children's Ministry | Room setup, check-in, curriculum, safety protocols |
| Worship Team | Sound check, set list, transitions, equipment |
| Assimilation | Connection cards, welcome center, guest follow-up |

### Using Checklists Effectively

- Distribute checklists to team leads before Launch Sunday
- Review checklists during pre-service team gatherings
- Use checklists to verify completion, not just guide action
- Update checklists based on what you learn each week

## 2. Video and Photography Capture

Launch Sunday is a day of celebration and remembrance. Give good thought to capturing the day so it can be remembered frequently and God glorified.

### Why Capture Matters

Many great launches have failed to adequately record this important day—to their lasting regret. Quality photos and video serve multiple purposes:

- **Memory** — Preserve this milestone for your church's history
- **Celebration** — Share highlights with partners and supporters
- **Promotion** — Use footage in future marketing and outreach
- **Testimony** — Document what God has done

### What to Capture

**Before Service:**
- Setup process and team preparation
- Prayer time with the Launch Team
- Exterior signage and facility
- Greeters welcoming guests

**During Service:**
- Worship moments
- Key portions of the message
- Congregation engagement
- Any special moments (dedications, commitments)

**After Service:**
- Fellowship and connections
- Children's ministry pickup
- Team celebration
- Candid moments of joy

### Quality Considerations

You don't need professional equipment, but you do need:
- Someone assigned specifically to this task (not serving in another role)
- A plan for what shots to capture
- Adequate storage for footage
- A backup plan if technology fails

## 3. Announcement in All Partner Churches

The week prior to launch, a PowerPoint slide of the Senior Pastor and family along with the launch announcement should go to every partner church in your network.

### Why This Matters

This powerful tie connects all churches and reminds everyone of God's great plans and mercy. It demonstrates that you're not alone—you're part of a broader movement of churches planting churches.

### What to Include

Your announcement slide should include:
- A quality photo of the Senior Pastor and family
- Church name and location
- Launch Sunday date and time
- A brief prayer request

### Execution Checklist

- [ ] Create announcement slide/graphic
- [ ] Compile list of all partner church contacts
- [ ] Send announcement **one week before** Launch Sunday
- [ ] Include a brief email with prayer requests
- [ ] Follow up with a thank-you after Launch Sunday

<Callout type="tip">
  Make it easy for partner churches to share. Provide the announcement in 
  multiple formats (16:9 slide, social media graphic, bulletin insert).
</Callout>

## 4. Partner Organization Role in the Service

Coordinate with your sending organization or partner network about their role in the Launch Sunday service. This honors the relationship and connects your new congregation to the broader body of Christ.

### Options for Partner Participation

**If a senior team member attends:**
- Introduce them during the service
- Allow them to briefly greet the congregation
- Have them pray over the church and leadership
- Acknowledge them publicly with gratitude

**If no one can attend:**
- Play a video greeting from network leadership
- Read a letter of blessing and commissioning
- Display a message from partners during announcements
- Share the story of how this partnership made the launch possible

### Coordination Steps

1. Contact your partner organization well in advance
2. Discuss what role would be appropriate
3. Confirm attendance or alternative participation
4. Prepare any needed elements (video, introduction, etc.)
5. Integrate seamlessly into the service flow

## 5. After-Service Celebration

Launch Sunday is a day of massive celebration recognizing God's goodness and mercy. Don't overlook some type of after-service gathering with the Launch Team.

### Why Celebrate?

Your Launch Team has invested months of prayer, giving, serving, and sacrifice. They need to pause and celebrate what God has accomplished before diving into the ongoing work of ministry.

Celebration:
- Honors the effort invested
- Builds team morale and unity
- Creates shared memories
- Acknowledges God's faithfulness

### Celebration Options

The celebration need not be expensive or elaborate—just something meaningful and thoughtful:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Lunch together | Reserve a restaurant or have a potluck |
| Dessert gathering | Simple and sweet after the service |
| Evening dinner | Allow time to rest before regathering |
| Backyard cookout | Casual and relational |

### Planning Considerations

- Plan the celebration in advance (don't scramble on Launch Sunday)
- Keep it simple enough to actually happen
- Include time for sharing and thanksgiving
- Consider family-friendly options
- Budget appropriately

<Callout type="insight">
  The celebration isn't just a party—it's a spiritual discipline. 
  Pausing to thank God and celebrate His faithfulness builds 
  faith for the journey ahead.
</Callout>

## Bringing It All Together

These five priorities work together to create a Launch Sunday that honors God, blesses your guests, and positions your church for the weeks ahead.

| Priority | Owner | Deadline |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Ministry Checklists | All Ministry Leaders | 1 week before |
| Video/Photo Plan | Promotion Leader | 1 week before |
| Partner Announcement | Senior Pastor | 1 week before |
| Partner Service Role | Senior Pastor | 2 weeks before |
| Celebration Plans | Launch Coordinator | 2 weeks before |

Assign clear ownership for each priority and set deadlines. Launch Sunday is too important to leave these details to chance.
