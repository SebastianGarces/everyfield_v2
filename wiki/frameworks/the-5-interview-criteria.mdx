Not everyone who attends a Vision Meeting and expresses interest is a good fit for your Core Group. Church planting is too demanding and too important to fill your team with people who aren't ready. The 5 Interview Criteria help you evaluate fit before formalizing commitment.

---

## Why Careful Evaluation Matters

It's tempting to accept anyone who shows enthusiasm. More people means more help, right?

Not necessarily.

The wrong people in your Core Group can:
- Drain energy instead of contributing it
- Create conflict and division
- Undermine culture and values
- Require excessive pastoral care at the wrong time
- Leave at critical moments, causing disruption

<Callout type="important">
  It's better to grow slowly with the right people than quickly with the wrong ones. A small, aligned Core Group outperforms a large, misaligned one every time.
</Callout>

## The 5 Criteria

When evaluating potential Core Group members, assess them across these five dimensions:

| Criterion | Key Question |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Maturity** | Are they spiritually and emotionally mature? |
| **Gifted** | Do they bring needed skills and abilities? |
| **Chemistry** | Is there good relational fit? |
| **Right Reasons** | Are they joining for healthy motivations? |
| **Season of Life** | Are they in a stable season? |

---

## Criterion 1: MATURITY

**Are they spiritually and emotionally mature?**

Church planting is spiritually intense. Your Core Group will face challenges that expose character weaknesses. Immature believers will struggle—and their struggles will become your problems.

### Spiritual Maturity Indicators

- Consistent personal devotional life
- Evidence of the fruit of the Spirit
- History of faithful church involvement
- Ability to handle disagreement graciously
- Teachable spirit
- Self-awareness of weaknesses

### Emotional Maturity Indicators

- Handles conflict constructively
- Takes responsibility rather than blaming
- Manages stress without destructive behavior
- Maintains appropriate boundaries
- Demonstrates resilience through difficulty
- Shows empathy and consideration for others

### Red Flags

- Chronic drama or conflict in relationships
- Inability to receive correction
- History of church hopping
- Unresolved major issues (addiction, marriage crisis)
- Excessive need for attention or validation
- Patterns of blaming others

<Callout type="tip">
  Maturity isn't about age or years as a Christian. Some young believers are remarkably mature; some longtime Christians never grow up. Look at fruit, not tenure.
</Callout>

## Criterion 2: GIFTED

**Do they bring needed skills and abilities?**

Every church plant needs specific skills to launch effectively. Evaluate what gifts a potential member brings and whether those gifts address current gaps.

### Gifts to Consider

| Area | Skills Needed |
|------|---------------|
| **Worship** | Musicians, vocalists, tech operators |
| **Children's Ministry** | Teachers, childcare, curriculum |
| **Hospitality** | Greeters, hosts, food preparation |
| **Administration** | Organization, finance, project management |
| **Technology** | AV, website, social media |
| **Facilities** | Setup, logistics, maintenance |

### Questions to Ask

- What spiritual gifts has this person demonstrated?
- What skills do they bring from their profession or experience?
- Does this address a current gap in our team?
- Are they willing to serve in their area of giftedness?

### Balance Giftedness with Other Criteria

Gifts matter, but they're not sufficient alone. A gifted musician with relational immaturity will cause more problems than they solve. A skilled administrator with wrong motivations will undermine culture.

<Callout type="warning">
  Don't overlook character flaws because someone fills a skill gap. Character problems don't improve under the pressure of church planting—they intensify.
</Callout>

## Criterion 3: CHEMISTRY

**Is there good relational fit?**

Church planting requires deep partnership. You'll spend significant time together under pressure. If the relational chemistry isn't there, that tension will compound over time.

### Chemistry Considerations

- Do you enjoy being around this person?
- Can you envision doing ministry together long-term?
- Do they fit with the existing Core Group dynamics?
- Is communication natural or forced?
- Do they share your sense of humor and approach to life?

### What Chemistry Is Not

Chemistry isn't about finding people exactly like you. Diversity strengthens teams. But there needs to be baseline relational compatibility—a sense that you can work together well.

### Trust Your Instincts

If something feels off relationally, pay attention. You don't need to diagnose exactly what's wrong. Sometimes chemistry simply isn't there, and that's okay.

---

## Criterion 4: RIGHT REASONS

**Are they joining for healthy motivations?**

People join church plants for various reasons. Some are healthy; others are not. Unhealthy motivations eventually surface and cause problems.

### Healthy Motivations

- Genuine sense of calling to this specific work
- Desire to build something for God's glory
- Excitement about the vision and values
- Wanting to grow and be stretched
- Longing to reach people for Christ

### Unhealthy Motivations

| Warning Sign | What It Reveals |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Fleeing a previous church conflict | Unresolved issues will follow them |
| Seeking position or title | Ego-driven, not mission-driven |
| Looking for a project to fix | May become controlling |
| Wanting to implement their agenda | Not aligned with your vision |
| Escaping accountability | Running from growth opportunities |
| Attracted to the novelty | Will leave when it gets hard |

### How to Discern Motivations

Ask directly:
- "Why do you want to be part of this church plant?"
- "What excites you about this?"
- "What are you hoping to find or experience?"
- "How did you leave your previous church?"

Listen carefully. Surface answers may mask deeper motivations. Follow up with probing questions.

<Callout type="insight">
  People rarely articulate their true motivations clearly, even to themselves. Watch behavior over time. Consistent patterns reveal genuine motivations.
</Callout>

## Criterion 5: SEASON OF LIFE

**Are they in a stable season?**

Church planting requires margin—time, energy, and emotional capacity to give. People in unstable life seasons often lack that margin, even with the best intentions.

### Seasons That May Indicate Readiness

- Established in career or vocation
- Stable marriage and family life
- Settled geographically (not planning to move)
- Manageable life responsibilities
- Past major life transitions (new baby, job change)

### Seasons That May Indicate Caution

| Situation | Concern |
|-----------|---------|
| Newlyweds (under 1 year) | Marriage needs priority attention |
| New parents (infant at home) | Sleep deprivation, limited capacity |
| Major career transition | Energy absorbed elsewhere |
| Health crisis (self or family) | Limited margin |
| Recent major move | Still establishing roots |
| Active conflict or crisis | Needs to be resolved first |

### The Conversation

Don't assume—ask directly:
- "What does your current life season look like?"
- "What major commitments are competing for your time?"
- "Do you have the margin to invest significantly in this?"
- "Are there any major life changes on the horizon?"

<Callout type="tip">
  A "not now" doesn't have to mean "not ever." If someone isn't ready due to life season, maintain the relationship. Their season will change, and they may be perfect for your church later.
</Callout>

## Conducting the Interview

### Before the Conversation

- Review your observations from Vision Meetings
- Note any concerns or questions
- Pray for discernment
- Prepare specific questions

### During the Conversation

1. **Create safety** — Make clear this is exploratory, not a test
2. **Share expectations** — Be clear about what Core Group membership requires
3. **Ask open questions** — Let them share; don't lead
4. **Listen more than talk** — Watch for what's beneath the surface
5. **Address concerns directly** — If you have questions, ask them
6. **Give them an out** — Make it easy to say no if they're not ready

### After the Conversation

- Debrief with your spouse or co-leader
- Pray before deciding
- If uncertain, wait—time reveals truth
- If clear, communicate your decision warmly

## When Someone Doesn't Fit

Not everyone will meet all five criteria. Handle these situations graciously:

- **Be honest** — Don't give false hope or vague answers
- **Be kind** — Rejection hurts; show compassion
- **Be specific** — If appropriate, share what needs to change
- **Keep the door open** — Circumstances change; people grow
- **Point them somewhere** — Help them find a good church home

<Callout type="warning">
  Avoiding hard conversations now creates bigger problems later. It's kinder to be honest upfront than to manage a bad fit for months.
</Callout>

Careful evaluation isn't unloving—it's wise stewardship. The quality of your Core Group determines the trajectory of your church plant. Take the time to evaluate well, and you'll build on a solid foundation.
