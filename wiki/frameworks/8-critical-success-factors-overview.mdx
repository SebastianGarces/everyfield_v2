Not all church plants succeed equally. Some launch strong and bear fruit for decades. Others struggle from day one and never gain traction. What makes the difference?

After observing numerous church plants, 8 critical success factors consistently distinguish healthy, fruitful launches from those that struggle.

## The 8 Factors

### 1. Vision Casting

**The ability and passion of the Senior Pastor to cast the vision in such a way that transforms interested individuals into COMMITTED, COMPELLED, CONTAGIOUS, and COURAGEOUS Core Group members.**

Vision casting isn't just describing what you want to build. It's painting a picture so compelling that people can't help but want to be part of it. It's helping them see what could be and inspiring them to sacrifice for it.

<Callout type="insight">
  People don't join organizations—they join movements. Your vision casting must
  make them feel the weight of what God is doing and the privilege of
  participating in it.
</Callout>

**Key questions:**
- Can people articulate the vision after hearing you share it?
- Do they feel compelled to tell others?
- Are they willing to sacrifice to make it happen?

---

### 2. Shared Ownership

**Core Group members own the responsibility equally with the Senior Pastor for growing the Core Group.**

The Senior Pastor cannot build the Core Group alone. If growth depends entirely on one person's networking and invitations, you'll plateau quickly.

Shared ownership means every Core Group member:
- Feels personally responsible for growth
- Actively invites people to Vision Meetings
- Owns the success or failure of the plant

<Callout type="warning">
  If only the Senior Pastor is inviting people, you have a club, not a movement.
  Shared ownership is non-negotiable.
</Callout>

---

### 3. Critical Mass

**Core Group grows to a minimum of 50 COMMITTED, COMPELLED, CONTAGIOUS, and COURAGEOUS adults (target goal: 100 adults).**

Numbers matter—not for vanity, but for sustainability. A church plant needs enough people to:
- Staff all ministry teams effectively
- Create energy in worship gatherings
- Provide financial sustainability
- Weather normal attrition without crisis

| Core Group Size | Reality |
|----------------|---------|
| Under 30 | High risk—likely underpowered for launch |
| 30-50 | Minimum viable—every person is critical |
| 50-75 | Solid foundation—room for some attrition |
| 75-100 | Strong position—multiple people for each role |
| 100+ | Excellent—positioned for growth from day one |

---

### 4. Unity

**A deep work of God's Spirit to grow the Core Group in unity and cohesiveness.**

Unity isn't just the absence of conflict—it's the presence of genuine love, shared vision, and mutual commitment. A unified Core Group can weather any storm. A divided one will fracture under pressure.

Unity requires:
- Time together (you can't rush community)
- Shared experiences (victories and challenges)
- Healthy conflict resolution (disagreements handled well)
- Common values (alignment on what matters most)

---

### 5. Prayer

**A commitment to consistent, fervent prayer which permeates the Core Group.**

Church planting is a spiritual battle. Only God can change hearts, open doors, and build His church. Prayer isn't an add-on to your strategy—it is your strategy.

<Callout type="important">
  A prayerless church plant is a powerless church plant. Make prayer central,
  not peripheral.
</Callout>

Prayer should be:
- **Consistent** — Regular rhythms, not sporadic bursts
- **Fervent** — Earnest and passionate, not routine
- **Permeating** — Woven through everything, not isolated to meetings

---

### 6. Generosity

**A sacrificial spirit of generosity evidenced among the Core Group to adequately launch the church.**

Launching a church costs money. Equipment, facilities, marketing, and operations all require funding. The primary source of that funding is the Core Group itself.

Generosity in the Core Group:
- Demonstrates commitment (people invest in what they believe in)
- Funds necessary purchases
- Models for future members what giving looks like
- Creates shared ownership through shared sacrifice

---

### 7. Emerging Leadership

**Leadership emerges from the Core Group to comprehensively own the 8 primary responsibilities of the launch.**

The Senior Pastor cannot do everything. For a healthy launch, leaders must emerge to own:

| Responsibility | Leader Needed |
|---------------|---------------|
| Worship | Worship Leader |
| Children's Ministry | Children's Ministry Leader |
| Facilities | Facilities Leader |
| Assimilation | Assimilation Leader |
| Small Groups | Small Group Leader |
| Promotion | Promotion Leader |
| Technology | Technology Leader |
| Project Management | Launch Coordinator |

<Callout type="tip">
  Identify potential leaders early. Give them increasing responsibility. By
  launch, they should fully own their areas with minimal supervision.
</Callout>

---

### 8. Comprehensive Training

**Training of the Core Group in the ministry model and the key responsibilities of the launch.**

Enthusiasm isn't enough. Your team needs to know how to execute their responsibilities with excellence. Training should cover:

- The ministry model and philosophy
- Specific role responsibilities
- Practical skills for execution
- Problem-solving for common issues

Untrained volunteers create chaos. Trained volunteers create excellence.

## How the Factors Work Together

These 8 factors aren't isolated—they reinforce each other:

```
VISION CASTING → attracts people with 4 C's
        ↓
SHARED OWNERSHIP → multiplies recruitment
        ↓
CRITICAL MASS → enables ministry teams
        ↓
UNITY → creates cohesive culture
        ↓
PRAYER → sustains spiritual vitality
        ↓
GENEROSITY → funds necessary resources
        ↓
EMERGING LEADERSHIP → distributes responsibility
        ↓
COMPREHENSIVE TRAINING → enables excellent execution
```

Weakness in any factor creates a bottleneck. Strength across all factors creates momentum.

## Self-Assessment

Regularly evaluate your church plant against these 8 factors:

| Factor | Strong | Adequate | Needs Work |
|--------|--------|----------|------------|
| Vision Casting | ◯ | ◯ | ◯ |
| Shared Ownership | ◯ | ◯ | ◯ |
| Critical Mass | ◯ | ◯ | ◯ |
| Unity | ◯ | ◯ | ◯ |
| Prayer | ◯ | ◯ | ◯ |
| Generosity | ◯ | ◯ | ◯ |
| Emerging Leadership | ◯ | ◯ | ◯ |
| Comprehensive Training | ◯ | ◯ | ◯ |

Identify your weakest factor and make it your focus. A chain is only as strong as its weakest link.
