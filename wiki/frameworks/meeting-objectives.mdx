Not all meetings are created equal. Many church plant gatherings become aimless—nice fellowship without clear purpose. To maximize every gathering, structure them around three key objectives: **Inspire**, **Instill**, and **Inform**.

---

## The Three Objectives

Every Core Group and Launch Team meeting should accomplish at least one of these objectives—ideally all three:

| Objective | Focus | Key Question |
|-----------|-------|--------------|
| **Inspire** | Vision and worship | "Are hearts stirred for what God is doing?" |
| **Instill** | Culture and values | "Are we deepening alignment with who we are?" |
| **Inform** | Training and updates | "Are people equipped to take action?" |

<Callout type="insight">
  These aren't separate meeting types—they're layers that should be present in every gathering. The best meetings inspire hearts, instill values, and inform minds in a single session.
</Callout>

## Objective 1: INSPIRE — Cast Vision

**Inspire gatherings renew people's vision of the Living God and remind them why you're planting the church.**

People leak vision. The excitement from last month fades. The pressures of daily life crowd out the calling. Regular inspiration counteracts this natural drift.

### What Inspiration Accomplishes

- Renews people's awareness of God's greatness
- Reminds them of the privilege of participating in His work
- Rekindles passion when energy wanes
- Creates unity around shared purpose
- Provides spiritual fuel for the hard work ahead

### How to Inspire

**Through worship:**
- Begin gatherings with worship and prayer
- Don't rush this—let people genuinely connect with God
- Worship reminds everyone who they're serving

**Through Scripture:**
- Share devotional thoughts that connect to the mission
- Let God's Word speak to hearts
- Ground the work in eternal truth

**Through stories:**
- Share what God is doing locally, nationally, and globally
- Celebrate answered prayers and milestones
- Tell stories of lives being changed

**Through vision casting:**
- Paint a picture of what the future church will look like
- Help people see beyond today's challenges to tomorrow's fruit
- Connect current sacrifice to future impact

<Callout type="tip">
  Great leaders continually cast vision. Don't assume people remember the vision just because you shared it once. Repeat it regularly, from different angles, with fresh illustrations.
</Callout>

## Objective 2: INSTILL — Enculturate the Team

**Instill gatherings thoroughly enculturate members in values, distinctives, and DNA.**

Culture isn't taught once—it's absorbed over time through repeated exposure. Instill meetings create that exposure, ensuring everyone deeply understands and embraces what makes your church distinctive.

### What Instilling Accomplishes

- Deepens understanding of core values
- Creates alignment on what matters most
- Builds shared language and understanding
- Develops ownership of the church's identity
- Prevents drift from foundational commitments

### How to Instill

**Through teaching:**
- Systematically teach through your 4 Pillars
- Explain the Worship/Walk/Work model
- Unpack your ministry philosophy and distinctives
- Don't assume—make implicit values explicit

**Through modeling:**
- Let people see values lived out, not just taught
- Share how you're applying values in real decisions
- Demonstrate the culture you want to create

**Through experience:**
- Visit established churches that embody your values
- Attend training events together
- Create shared experiences that reinforce culture

**Through discussion:**
- Process values together, not just lecture
- Let people ask questions and wrestle
- Build understanding through dialogue

<Callout type="important">
  Alignment creates power. When everyone deeply understands and resonates with your values, enormous energy, joy, and momentum are produced. Misalignment creates friction and confusion.
</Callout>

### What to Instill

| Area | Content |
|------|---------|
| **Theology** | Doctrinal commitments, statement of faith |
| **Philosophy** | Why you do ministry the way you do |
| **Values** | The 4 Pillars and core commitments |
| **Model** | Worship/Walk/Work ministry funnel |
| **Distinctives** | What makes this church unique |
| **Expectations** | What you're asking of Core Group members |

## Objective 3: INFORM — Train the Team

**Inform gatherings equip people with the knowledge and skills they need to take action.**

Inspiration without information leaves people stirred but stuck. They want to help but don't know how. Inform meetings bridge the gap between motivation and execution.

### What Informing Accomplishes

- Transfers practical knowledge and skills
- Prepares people for their specific roles
- Provides updates on progress and next steps
- Enables confident action
- Reduces anxiety about the unknown

### How to Inform

**Through training:**
- Ministry-specific skills development
- Role-based preparation
- Hands-on practice and rehearsal
- Outside training events and resources

**Through updates:**
- Progress reports on key milestones
- Timeline and deadline communication
- Changes and adjustments to plans
- Celebration of what's been accomplished

**Through next steps:**
- Clear action items for individuals and teams
- Specific assignments with deadlines
- Resources needed for completion
- Follow-up and accountability structures

<Callout type="tip">
  Information overload kills action. Focus each meeting on the most important information people need right now. Save the rest for later.
</Callout>

## Balancing the Three Objectives

### Early Core Group Phase

**Emphasis: Inspire + Instill**

Early on, focus primarily on vision casting and cultural formation. People need to fall in love with the vision and deeply absorb the values. Training can wait until you're closer to launch.

| Objective | Approximate Time |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Inspire | 30-40% |
| Instill | 40-50% |
| Inform | 10-20% |

### Launch Team Phase

**Emphasis: All Three**

Once you transition to Launch Team with a set date, training becomes critical. Now you need all three objectives in balance.

| Objective | Approximate Time |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Inspire | 25-30% |
| Instill | 25-30% |
| Inform | 40-50% |

### Pre-Launch Phase

**Emphasis: Inform + Inspire**

In the final weeks, training intensifies. But don't neglect inspiration—people need spiritual fuel for the sprint to launch.

| Objective | Approximate Time |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Inspire | 20-25% |
| Instill | 15-20% |
| Inform | 55-65% |

## Structuring a Meeting

Here's a typical meeting structure that incorporates all three objectives:

| Time | Activity | Objective |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 0:00-0:15 | Worship and prayer | Inspire |
| 0:15-0:25 | Devotional/Scripture | Inspire |
| 0:25-0:35 | Vision updates and stories | Inspire |
| 0:35-0:55 | Teaching on values/model | Instill |
| 0:55-1:15 | Training content | Inform |
| 1:15-1:25 | Updates and next steps | Inform |
| 1:25-1:30 | Prayer and dismissal | Inspire |

<Callout type="warning">
  Don't skip the Inspire portion to save time. You can have the most informed team in the world, but without inspiration, they'll burn out or drift away.
</Callout>

## Common Mistakes

### All Inspire, No Inform

**Symptom:** People feel excited but don't know what to do.

**Solution:** Add practical training and clear next steps to every meeting.

### All Inform, No Inspire

**Symptom:** Meetings feel like work sessions; passion fades.

**Solution:** Always begin with worship and vision. Connect tasks to the bigger picture.

### Neglecting Instill

**Symptom:** People are busy but not aligned; confusion about values and direction.

**Solution:** Systematically teach your distinctives. Don't assume—make values explicit.

### One-Size-Fits-All

**Symptom:** Same meeting format regardless of phase or need.

**Solution:** Adjust emphasis based on where you are in the launch process.

Every meeting is an opportunity. When you intentionally inspire hearts, instill values, and inform minds, gatherings become transformative rather than transactional. Make every meeting count.
