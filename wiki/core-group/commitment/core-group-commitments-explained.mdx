The Commitments of a Core Group document outlines 12 foundational commitments that every Core Group member embraces. These aren't arbitrary rules—they're the convictions that will shape your church's identity and ensure alignment with the broader movement.

This article explains each commitment so you can discuss them clearly with your Core Group and help members understand what they're agreeing to.

## The 12 Core Group Commitments

### 1. Commitment to the Four Pillars and Core Values

Every healthy church stands on foundational pillars. For your church plant, these are non-negotiable convictions that shape everything you do.

**Why This Matters:** Without shared values, a church becomes a collection of individuals with different agendas. The 4 Pillars create unity of purpose and direction.

**What This Looks Like:**
- Core Group members can articulate the 4 Pillars
- Decisions are evaluated against these values
- New members are taught the pillars early in their journey

<Callout type="tip">
  If you can't explain the 4 Pillars in a conversation, you haven't internalized them yet. Work on this until it's natural.
</Callout>

### 2. Commitment to Quality Discipleship

The church exists to make disciples—authentic disciples who **Worship**, **Walk with**, and **Work for** Christ. This is the ministry model that drives everything.

**Why This Matters:** Many churches gather crowds without making disciples. This commitment ensures that transformation—not just attendance—is the goal.

**What This Looks Like:**
- Programs and ministries are evaluated by their discipleship effectiveness
- Every member is on a growth path, not just consuming content
- Leaders are developed, not just recruited

---

### 3. Commitment to the Doctrinal Statement

A shared doctrinal foundation prevents the confusion and conflict that comes when people hold fundamentally different beliefs about essential truths.

**Why This Matters:** Doctrinal clarity protects the church from error and ensures that teaching is consistent and trustworthy.

**What This Looks Like:**
- Core Group members have read and affirmed the doctrinal statement
- Teaching aligns with these convictions
- Disagreements on secondary issues don't divide the community

<Callout type="important">
  This doesn't mean every member agrees on every minor point of theology. It means everyone agrees on the essentials that define the faith.
</Callout>

---

### 4. Commitment to the By-Laws

By-laws govern how the church operates—decision-making processes, membership requirements, leadership structures, and more.

**Why This Matters:** Clear governance prevents power struggles and ensures the church operates with integrity and accountability.

**What This Looks Like:**
- Leaders understand and follow established procedures
- Changes to governance go through proper channels
- The church operates transparently

---

### 5. Commitment to Elder Governance

The church commits to an elder form of church government, with qualified men providing spiritual oversight and leadership.

**Why This Matters:** Elder governance is a biblical model that provides accountability, wisdom, and shared leadership. It protects against the dangers of single-leader authority.

**What This Looks Like:**
- The Senior Pastor works under elder oversight
- Major decisions involve elder input and approval
- Elders are selected based on biblical qualifications (1 Timothy 3, Titus 1)

---

### 6. Commitment to Network Partnership

If your church is part of a broader network or denomination, this commitment ensures alignment with partnership agreements and trademark requirements.

**Why This Matters:** Network partnership provides accountability, support, and shared resources. Honoring these agreements maintains trust and relationship.

**What This Looks Like:**
- Using the network's name and branding appropriately
- Participating in network events and relationships
- Maintaining communication with network leadership

---

### 7. Commitment to Church Name and Location

The church commits to its name and geographic designation as part of its identity and network alignment.

**Why This Matters:** Consistent naming creates clarity for the community and maintains connection to the broader movement.

**What This Looks Like:**
- The church uses its full, designated name in public communications
- Branding and signage reflect the approved identity
- Any name considerations go through proper approval processes

---

### 8. Commitment to Church Planting

The church commits to supporting future church plants, typically through contributing 5% of the annual budget to church planting efforts.

**Why This Matters:** Healthy churches reproduce. This commitment ensures that multiplication is part of the DNA from day one—not an afterthought once the church is "established."

**What This Looks Like:**
- Budget allocation for church planting is prioritized, not optional
- The church actively prays for and encourages future planters
- Members understand that the church exists not just for itself but for the Kingdom

<Callout type="insight">
  Committing to church planting before you've even launched demonstrates faith and kingdom-mindedness. It's one of the most counter-cultural commitments you'll make.
</Callout>

---

### 9. Commitment to Ongoing Training

The church commits to participating in training seminars and continuing education for leadership development.

**Why This Matters:** Leaders who stop learning stop growing. This commitment ensures that the church continues to develop and improve.

**What This Looks Like:**
- Leaders attend required training events
- The church invests in leadership development resources
- A culture of learning and growth is cultivated

---

### 10. Commitment Regarding Senior Pastor Transitions

For the first five years, the church commits to specific processes around Senior Pastor transitions to protect the young church during its most vulnerable period.

**Why This Matters:** Pastoral transitions in young churches can be devastating. This commitment provides stability and clear expectations during a critical growth period.

**What This Looks Like:**
- Clear protocols exist for how transitions would be handled
- The Senior Pastor understands the commitment and its purpose
- Elder and network involvement in any transition discussions

---

### 11. Commitment to Elder Partnership in Year One

In the first year, the church commits to working closely with elder oversight, often from the broader network or partner churches.

**Why This Matters:** New churches benefit from experienced guidance. This commitment ensures the Senior Pastor has wise counsel during the most challenging early days.

**What This Looks Like:**
- Regular communication with oversight elders
- Major decisions made in consultation with partner elders
- A spirit of humility and teachability from church leadership

---

### 12. Commitment to Network Fellowship

The church commits to active fellowship with other churches in the network—not isolation but genuine partnership.

**Why This Matters:** Churches that isolate become insular and vulnerable. Fellowship with other churches provides encouragement, accountability, and shared mission.

**What This Looks Like:**
- Attending network gatherings and events
- Building relationships with other church leaders
- Sharing resources, ideas, and encouragement across churches

---

## Discussing These Commitments with Your Core Group

Don't just hand people a document and ask them to sign. Take time to discuss each commitment:

1. **Explain the "why"** — Help people understand the purpose behind each commitment
2. **Answer questions** — Create space for honest questions and concerns
3. **Share the vision** — Connect commitments to the larger picture of what you're building
4. **Acknowledge the cost** — Be honest that these commitments require sacrifice

<Callout type="warning">
  If someone has significant objections to one of these commitments, don't pressure them to sign anyway. This is exactly what the process is designed to surface.
</Callout>

---

## When Commitment Feels Hard

Some of these commitments may feel challenging to prospective Core Group members:

- **Financial commitments** may stretch tight budgets
- **Time commitments** may compete with other priorities
- **Doctrinal commitments** may require setting aside personal preferences

This is where the **4 C's** become essential. Core Group members must be **COMMITTED, COMPELLED, CONTAGIOUS, and COURAGEOUS**—willing to sacrifice for something bigger than themselves.

If someone isn't ready for that level of commitment, they may be better suited for involvement after the church launches rather than during the Core Group phase.

---

## Revisiting Commitments

These commitments aren't "sign once and forget." Periodically revisit them as a Core Group:

- **Celebrate alignment** — Acknowledge when the group is living out these commitments well
- **Address drift** — If the group is drifting from a commitment, name it and correct course
- **Reinforce purpose** — Remind the group why these commitments matter

Healthy accountability keeps commitments alive and meaningful.
