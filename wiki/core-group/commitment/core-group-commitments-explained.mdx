When someone joins the Core Group, they're committing to more than just attending meetings. They're entering into a covenant relationship with shared responsibilities and mutual accountability.

This guide explains each commitment in detail—what it means, why it matters, and what it looks like in practice.

---

## The Core Commitments

Every Core Group member commits to these fundamental responsibilities. These aren't optional extras—they're the essence of what Core Group membership means.

### Commitment to the Three Primary Assignments

#### 1. Grow the Core Group

**What it means:**
Every Core Group member actively works to build the Core Group numerically. This isn't delegated to the Senior Pastor or a few outgoing personalities—everyone owns it.

**Why it matters:**
Without shared ownership of growth, the Core Group plateaus. The more people inviting, the more networks accessed, the faster the group grows to critical mass.

**What it looks like:**
- Setting personal invitation goals (minimum 5 invitations per Vision Meeting)
- Bringing at least one person or couple to every Vision Meeting
- Using sphere of influence to identify potential members
- Asking the Lord to direct to those whose hearts He is preparing
- Celebrating when someone you invited joins

<Callout type="important">
  This is the most critical commitment. A Core Group where everyone invites grows exponentially. A Core Group where only the pastor invites grows slowly, if at all.
</Callout>

#### 2. Pray

**What it means:**
Each Core Group member owns responsibility for fervent, faithful prayer for the church plant and its people.

**Why it matters:**
Planting a church is the work of God—only He can build the church. Prayer isn't just a spiritual add-on; it's the foundation everything else builds upon.

**What it looks like:**
- Daily personal prayer for the church plant
- Praying for other Core Group members by name
- Praying for people being invited and cultivated
- Attending corporate prayer gatherings
- Fasting as led by the Spirit

#### 3. Give

**What it means:**
Core Group members give financially—generously, faithfully, sacrificially, and joyfully—to fund the church plant.

**Why it matters:**
Primary funding comes through the Core Group. There's no outside organization writing checks. God provides through His people.

**What it looks like:**
- Regular, consistent giving (not sporadic)
- Sacrificial giving (it costs something)
- Joyful giving (not grudging or obligated)
- Trusting God to provide as you give

## Commitment to Doctrine and Values

### Commitment to the Four Pillars

**What it means:**
Core Group members embrace and support the church's foundational pillars—the core convictions that shape everything the church does.

**Why it matters:**
Alignment on fundamentals creates unity. When everyone shares the same convictions about what matters most, you can move together with power.

### Commitment to Quality Discipleship (Worship/Walk/Work)

**What it means:**
Core Group members embrace the church's model for making disciples—people who Worship God, Walk with God, and Work for God.

**Why it matters:**
This isn't just a slogan; it's a framework for spiritual growth. Core Group members should be living this out themselves and helping others do the same.

### Commitment to Doctrinal Statement

**What it means:**
Core Group members affirm the church's statement of faith. They may have questions or hold some positions tentatively, but there's no fundamental disagreement with core doctrines.

**Why it matters:**
Doctrinal unity is essential for effective ministry. A Core Group divided on fundamental beliefs can't teach or model coherent faith.

### Commitment to By-Laws

**What it means:**
Core Group members accept the church's governance structure and agree to operate within it.

**Why it matters:**
Clear governance prevents conflict and confusion. Everyone should know how decisions are made and who has authority for what.

### Commitment to Elder Governance

**What it means:**
Core Group members affirm the elder form of church government, where qualified elders provide spiritual oversight and leadership.

**Why it matters:**
This is a significant ecclesiological decision. Members need to understand and accept this structure before joining.

<Callout type="insight">
  These doctrinal and structural commitments filter for alignment. Someone who fundamentally disagrees with elder governance shouldn't join a church committed to it.
</Callout>

## Commitment to Organizational Identity

### Commitment to Network Affiliation

**What it means:**
Core Group members embrace the church's connection to its broader network or denomination, including any trademark or affiliation agreements.

**Why it matters:**
Being part of a network provides resources, accountability, and partnership. Members should understand and support this connection.

### Commitment to Church Name

**What it means:**
Core Group members support the church name, including its geographic identifier if applicable.

**Why it matters:**
The name is part of the identity. There shouldn't be ongoing debate about what to call the church.

### Commitment to Church Planting

**What it means:**
Core Group members support the church's commitment to plant other churches—typically expressed as a percentage of budget (e.g., 5%) given toward church planting.

**Why it matters:**
Church planting churches plant churches. Building this into the DNA from the beginning ensures it's part of the culture, not an afterthought.

## Commitment to Unity and Process

### Commitment to Ongoing Training

**What it means:**
Core Group members participate in training seminars, workshops, and development opportunities as provided.

**Why it matters:**
The Core Group needs to be equipped for the work ahead. Training prepares members for their eventual Launch Team roles.

### Commitment Regarding Pastoral Transitions

**What it means:**
Core Group members understand the process for pastoral transitions, especially in the critical first five years. This typically involves network oversight and approval.

**Why it matters:**
Early-stage churches are vulnerable. Having clear process for handling pastoral changes protects the church during a fragile period.

### Commitment to Elder Partnership

**What it means:**
In the first year, the Core Group operates under elder partnership with the network or sponsoring church. This provides accountability and support during establishment.

**Why it matters:**
New churches benefit from experienced oversight. This partnership ensures healthy foundations are laid.

### Commitment to Network Fellowship

**What it means:**
Core Group members support ongoing relationship with other churches in the network—attending events, sharing resources, and maintaining connection.

**Why it matters:**
Isolation is dangerous for churches. Connection with a network provides encouragement, resources, and accountability.

## Living Out the Commitments

### What Healthy Commitment Looks Like

| Area | Healthy | Concerning |
|------|---------|------------|
| **Attendance** | Consistent, prioritized | Sporadic, always has excuses |
| **Invitation** | Active, hitting goals | Passive, rarely invites |
| **Giving** | Regular, sacrificial | Inconsistent or absent |
| **Prayer** | Engaged, faithful | Neglected or forgotten |
| **Unity** | Supportive, constructive | Critical, divisive |
| **Engagement** | Growing, contributing | Coasting, disengaged |

### When Commitments Aren't Kept

If someone isn't fulfilling their commitments, address it directly but graciously:

1. **Notice early** — Don't wait until it's a pattern
2. **Inquire privately** — "How are things going? I've noticed..."
3. **Reference the commitment** — "When you joined, you committed to..."
4. **Problem-solve together** — "What would help you get back on track?"
5. **Follow up** — Check in again to see if things improve
6. **Release if necessary** — Some people need to step back

<Callout type="tip">
  Most people who struggle with commitments have something going on beneath the surface—stress at work, family issues, spiritual dryness. Approach with curiosity and care, not accusation.
</Callout>

## Renewal and Transition

### When Core Group Becomes Launch Team

When the launch date is set and the Core Group transitions to Launch Team, consider having members re-affirm their commitment for the new phase.

### Post-Launch

After launch, Core Group commitments transition into church membership. The intensity of the Core Group phase gives way to the ongoing rhythms of church life—but the foundational commitments remain.

The early church was marked by devotion—wholehearted commitment to the essential practices of Christian community. Core Group commitments call us to the same kind of devotion as we build Christ's church together.
