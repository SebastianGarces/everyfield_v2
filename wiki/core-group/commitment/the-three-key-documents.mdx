Formalizing commitment requires documentation. Three key documents work together to create clarity, set expectations, and establish mutual accountability between Core Group members and leadership.

This guide explains each document's purpose and how they work together.

## Overview of the Three Documents

| Document | Purpose | Who Signs |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| **Expectations of a Core Group** | Explains what Core Group membership involves | No signature—informational |
| **Commitment Card** | Individual member's commitment | Each Core Group member |
| **Commitments of a Core Group** | Church's commitment to the Core Group | Senior Pastor or designated leader |

These documents create a clear covenant between the individual, the Core Group, and leadership. Everyone knows what's expected and what's promised.

<Callout type="insight">
  Think of these documents as a covenant, not a contract. They establish a relational commitment grounded in shared mission, not a legal agreement with penalties for breach.
</Callout>

## Document 1: Expectations of a Core Group

### Purpose

Before people can wholeheartedly commit, they need to know what they're committing to. This document brings clarity and simplicity to what Core Group membership involves.

This is **informational, not a signature document**. It's given to prospective members so they can understand expectations before being asked to commit.

### What It Should Include

**The Three Primary Assignments:**
1. Grow the Core Group — actively inviting and bringing people to Vision Meetings
2. Pray — fervent, faithful prayer for the church plant
3. Give — generous, consistent financial support

**Meeting Expectations:**
- Attendance at Core Group gatherings (frequency)
- Attendance at Vision Meetings
- Participation in training and special events

**Character Expectations:**
- Unity and support for leadership
- Handling disagreement constructively
- Maintaining confidentiality when appropriate
- Positive representation of the church in the community

**Duration:**
- How long the Core Group phase lasts
- What happens at launch
- Transition from Core Group to Launch Team to church member

### How to Use It

1. Give the document to interested individuals after follow-up conversations
2. Walk through it together, explaining each point
3. Answer questions and address concerns
4. Give them time to consider before asking for commitment

<Callout type="tip">
  Don't just hand someone the document and disappear. Walk through it with them. This creates opportunity for questions and demonstrates that you take commitment seriously.
</Callout>

## Document 2: Commitment Card

### Purpose

The Commitment Card is what each Core Group member signs to formalize their commitment. It brings clarity and simplicity to the commitment process and creates a clear moment of decision.

This is the individual's **personal commitment** to the Core Group and its mission.

### What It Should Include

**Personal Information:**
- Name
- Contact information
- Date

**Statement of Commitment:**
A clear statement they're agreeing to, such as:

*"I have read and understand the Expectations of a Core Group. I commit to fulfilling these expectations to the best of my ability. I understand that this commitment is for the duration of the Core Group phase and that I will be held accountable to these expectations."*

**Specific Commitments:**
Checkboxes or statements affirming commitment to:
- [ ] Attending Core Group gatherings consistently
- [ ] Praying regularly for the church plant
- [ ] Giving financially as God enables
- [ ] Actively inviting others to Vision Meetings
- [ ] Supporting the vision and leadership of the church

**Signature and Date:**
Space for the person to sign and date their commitment.

### How to Use It

1. Present the card after the person has reviewed the Expectations document
2. Walk through what they're signing
3. Personally challenge them to commit
4. Give them space to sign (or time to consider if needed)
5. Keep the signed card on file
6. Provide them a copy if requested

## Document 3: Commitments of a Core Group

### Purpose

Commitment goes both ways. Just as individuals commit to the Core Group, the church commits to them. This document lays out what the Core Group can expect from leadership.

The Senior Pastor or designated leader signs this **on behalf of the church and its leadership**.

### What It Should Include

**Commitments to the Individual:**
- Spiritual care and shepherding
- Clear communication about expectations and plans
- Meaningful gatherings that develop and equip
- Opportunity to use gifts and serve meaningfully
- Support during difficult seasons

**Doctrinal and Organizational Commitments:**
This is where you spell out what the church is committed to theologically and organizationally:

1. Commitment to the Four Pillars and core values
2. Commitment to quality discipleship (Worship/Walk/Work)
3. Commitment to the doctrinal statement
4. Commitment to the by-laws and governance structure
5. Commitment to the elder form of church government
6. Commitment to the church name and identity
7. Commitment to church planting (e.g., 5% of annual budget)
8. Commitment to ongoing training and development
9. Commitment to transparency and accountability in finances
10. Commitment to fellowship with network churches

**Signature:**
Signed by the Senior Pastor or authorized leader on behalf of the Core Group.

<Callout type="important">
  This document signals that leadership takes commitment seriously too. It's not just about what you expect from them—it's about what they can expect from you.
</Callout>

### How to Use It

1. Present this document alongside the individual's Commitment Card
2. Explain that commitment is mutual
3. Sign it in front of them (or have it pre-signed)
4. Give them a copy to keep

## How the Documents Work Together

The three documents create a complete picture:

```
Expectations Document
  "Here's what Core Group membership involves"
         ↓
Individual Commitment Card
  "I commit to these expectations"
         ↓
Church Commitment Document
  "We commit to you as well"
```

**For the prospective member:** They receive clear information, make an informed decision, and know what they can expect from leadership.

**For leadership:** You have documented commitments you can reference, and you've established mutual accountability.

**For the Core Group:** There's clarity about what membership means and what everyone has agreed to.

## Creating Your Documents

### Starting Points

Work with your coach or network to obtain template documents you can customize. Most church planting networks have standard documents you can adapt.

### Customization

Adapt templates to fit your specific context:
- Your church's distinctives and values
- Your network's expectations
- Your local situation and timing

### Legal Considerations

These are commitment documents, not legal contracts. However, it's wise to:
- Have your by-laws and governance documents professionally reviewed
- Ensure commitment language is clear but not legally binding in problematic ways
- Keep signed documents on file appropriately

<Callout type="tip">
  Keep the commitment card simple. One page is ideal. The purpose is clarity and commitment, not comprehensive coverage of every possible situation.
</Callout>

## Timing in the Process

| When | What Happens |
|------|--------------|
| First Vision Meeting | Person hears vision, not yet ready for commitment |
| Follow-Up Conversation | Begin discussing commitment, answer questions |
| Second/Third Vision Meeting | Deepening interest, continued conversation |
| Interview Meeting | Assess fit, discuss expectations in detail |
| Commitment Invitation | Present Expectations document, walk through it |
| Commitment Moment | Present Commitment Card, challenge to sign |
| Welcome | Sign Church Commitments document, welcome to Core Group |
