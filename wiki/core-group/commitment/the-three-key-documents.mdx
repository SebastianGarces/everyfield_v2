Before people can wholeheartedly commit to your Core Group, they need to know exactly what they're committing to. Vague expectations lead to misunderstandings, disappointment, and eventually, attrition.

Three key documents bring clarity and simplicity to the commitment process. Each serves a distinct purpose, and together they create a complete picture of what Core Group membership means.

---

## Document 1: Expectations of a Core Group Member

This document answers the question every prospective member is asking: **"What will be expected of me?"**

### Purpose

The Expectations document brings clarity before someone commits. It prevents the uncomfortable situation where someone joins, discovers what's really required, and feels trapped or misled.

Think of it as informed consent. You're saying, "Here's what this involves. Make sure you're ready before you sign up."

### What It Should Include

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Time Commitment** | Attendance at Core Group meetings, Vision Meetings, training events |
| **Financial Commitment** | Regular giving, sacrificial support of the launch |
| **Ministry Involvement** | Active participation in building the Core Group, serving in a ministry area |
| **Spiritual Disciplines** | Personal prayer, Bible study, accountability |
| **Relational Expectations** | Unity with other members, conflict resolution, confidentiality |
| **Duration** | Commitment through launch and the initial post-launch period |

<Callout type="tip">
  Be specific. "Regular attendance" is vague. "Attending 90% of Core Group meetings and all major training events" is clear.
</Callout>

### Tone and Approach

Write this document in a way that's direct but not cold. You're not drafting a legal contract—you're helping someone understand what they're joining.

Lead with the "why" behind each expectation. People are more willing to commit when they understand the purpose, not just the requirement.

## Document 2: The Commitment Card

This document is what each individual Core Group member signs. It transforms verbal interest into documented commitment.

### Purpose

The Commitment Card creates a moment of decision. It moves someone from "I'm interested" to "I'm committed." That distinction matters enormously.

Signing the card is also a personal declaration. The member is saying, "I've counted the cost, and I'm all in."

### What It Should Include

- **Personal Information** — Name, contact details
- **Affirmation of Understanding** — Acknowledgment that they've read and understood the expectations
- **Commitment Statement** — A clear declaration of commitment to the Core Group and its mission
- **Signature and Date** — Making it official

### Sample Commitment Statement

> *"I have read and understood the Expectations of a Core Group Member. I commit to fulfilling these expectations to the best of my ability, relying on God's grace and strength. I understand that the Core Group is the foundation of this church plant, and I embrace my responsibility to contribute to its health and growth."*

<Callout type="important">
  Keep the Commitment Card simple and focused. This isn't the place for detailed policies—that's what the Expectations document is for.
</Callout>

### When to Present It

Don't rush to the Commitment Card. Present it only after someone has:

1. Attended at least one Vision Meeting
2. Had a follow-up conversation with leadership
3. Been given the Expectations document to review
4. Had time to pray and consider

The goal is informed commitment, not pressured signatures.

## Document 3: Commitments of the Core Group

While the first two documents focus on individual members, this document represents what the Core Group collectively commits to—typically what the church itself will uphold.

### Purpose

This document ensures alignment on foundational issues. It's not about individual behavior but about shared convictions and direction.

Either the Senior Pastor or a designated leader signs this on behalf of the Core Group, signifying that the group as a whole embraces these commitments.

### What It Should Include

The Commitments of a Core Group typically address:

| Commitment Area | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| **Core Values** | Commitment to the 4 Pillars and foundational values |
| **Discipleship Model** | Commitment to producing authentic disciples who Worship, Walk with, and Work for Christ |
| **Doctrinal Standards** | Commitment to the doctrinal statement |
| **Governance** | Commitment to the by-laws and elder form of church government |
| **Network Alignment** | Commitment to partnership agreements and trademark requirements |
| **Church Identity** | Commitment to the church name and geographic designation |
| **Church Planting** | Commitment to supporting future church plants (typically 5% of annual budget) |
| **Ongoing Development** | Commitment to training seminars and continuing education |
| **Leadership Transitions** | Commitment regarding Senior Pastor transitions in the first five years |
| **Elder Partnership** | Commitment to working with elder oversight in the first year |
| **Network Fellowship** | Commitment to fellowship with other churches in the network |

<Callout type="insight">
  This document protects both the Core Group and the broader network. It ensures that the church being planted will align with the values and practices that define the movement.
</Callout>

### Why This Matters

New members need to know they're joining something with clear convictions. The Commitments document shows that this isn't a make-it-up-as-we-go operation—it's a church built on defined principles.

It also provides a reference point if questions arise later. "This is what we committed to" is a powerful statement when navigating challenges.

## How the Three Documents Work Together

Think of these documents as layers:

1. **Expectations** — What the Core Group expects of you (individual requirements)
2. **Commitment Card** — Your personal response to those expectations (individual agreement)
3. **Core Group Commitments** — What we collectively stand for (shared convictions)

Together, they create full clarity about what Core Group membership means—both what you're giving and what you're joining.

```
EXPECTATIONS DOCUMENT
        ↓
   "Here's what we ask"
        ↓
COMMITMENT CARD
        ↓
   "I agree and commit"
        ↓
CORE GROUP COMMITMENTS
        ↓
   "This is who we are together"
```

## Practical Implementation

### Creating the Documents

1. **Draft with input** — Have your coach or mentor review your documents before finalizing
2. **Keep them accessible** — Use clear language; avoid jargon or overly formal phrasing
3. **Design intentionally** — These documents represent your church; make them look professional

### Presenting the Documents

1. **Don't surprise people** — Mention that formal commitment is part of the process early in conversations
2. **Explain the "why"** — Help people understand that this protects everyone, not just the leadership
3. **Give time to process** — Let people take documents home, pray, and discuss with family

### Storing the Documents

1. **Keep signed copies** — Maintain a record of all signed Commitment Cards
2. **Review periodically** — As the Core Group grows, occasionally revisit the documents to ensure they're still serving their purpose

Clear commitment documents enable your Core Group members to say "yes" with full understanding—and mean it.
