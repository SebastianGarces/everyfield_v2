Commitment in church planting is vital and extremely important. But commitment that lives only in someone's mind is unreliable. Formalized commitment—documented, signed, and clear—transforms good intentions into concrete action.

Having Core Group members sign a commitment card is a powerful way to reinforce and strengthen commitment. Here's why this matters and how to do it well.

## The Problem with Informal Commitment

Without formalized commitment, you face several challenges:

### Unclear Expectations

When someone says "I'm in," what do they actually mean? Do they understand what's expected? Have they counted the cost? Informal commitment often masks unclear expectations.

### Easy Exit

When commitment is just verbal, it's easy to walk away. "I never really committed to that" becomes a convenient excuse when things get hard.

### Inconsistent Engagement

Without clear expectations documented, some people show up consistently while others drift in and out. There's no standard to point to.

### Leadership Uncertainty

You can't build a church on uncertain commitments. You need to know who's actually in—who you can count on, who will be there when it matters.

  Formalized commitment isn't about control or legalism. It's about clarity and intentionality. People deserve to know exactly what they're signing up for, and you deserve to know who's truly committed.

## What Formalized Commitment Accomplishes

### 1. Brings Clarity

A written commitment card makes expectations explicit. There's no ambiguity about what Core Group membership involves. People know exactly what they're agreeing to.

### 2. Creates a Moment of Decision

Signing a commitment card creates a clear moment of decision. It's a line crossed—a before and after. This psychological marker reinforces the commitment.

### 3. Strengthens Resolve

Research consistently shows that written commitments are more powerful than verbal ones. The act of signing activates a deeper level of commitment.

### 4. Enables Accountability

With documented commitments, you have a standard to point to. When someone isn't fulfilling their commitment, you can have a direct conversation grounded in what they agreed to.

### 5. Filters for Seriousness

Some people will balk at signing a commitment card. That's okay—and actually helpful. It filters out those who aren't ready for this level of commitment.

  The commitment card isn't a barrier to entry designed to exclude people. It's a clarifying tool designed to ensure the right people, with full understanding, make intentional decisions.

## What Makes Commitment Work

Formalized commitment only works if certain conditions are met:

### Clear Understanding

Before people can wholeheartedly commit, they need to understand expectations. This is why the commitment process includes an Expectations document that spells out exactly what's involved.

### Willing Hearts

Commitment should never be coerced. People sign because they've caught the vision, assessed the cost, and want to be part of building the church. Pressured commitment doesn't last.

### Mutual Accountability

Commitment goes both ways. The Core Group commits to the individual just as the individual commits to the Core Group. Both parties have responsibilities.

### Ongoing Reinforcement

Signing a card is just the beginning. Commitment needs to be reinforced through meaningful gatherings, shared experiences, and continued vision casting.

## Common Objections to Formalized Commitment

### "Isn't this too corporate? This is a church, not a business."

Commitment cards aren't corporate—they're biblical. The early church took commitment seriously. Membership and covenant have always been part of the church's DNA. Formalizing commitment isn't adding something foreign; it's reclaiming something essential.

### "What if it scares people away?"

It will scare some people away—and that's a feature, not a bug. You want people who are willing to make a clear commitment. Those who aren't ready aren't ready. They can attend Vision Meetings until they are.

### "We're a grace-based community. This feels legalistic."

Grace doesn't mean no expectations. Jesus called disciples to radical commitment. Being clear about expectations is actually more gracious than being vague and then being disappointed when people don't meet unstated standards.

### "Do we really need paperwork?"

Yes. Verbal commitment is easily forgotten or reinterpreted. Written commitment creates clarity, accountability, and a reference point for future conversations.

## The Commitment Process

A healthy commitment process typically includes:

### 1. Full Information

Before asking anyone to commit, ensure they've:
- Attended at least one Vision Meeting
- Had a follow-up conversation
- Received the Expectations document
- Had their questions answered

### 2. Personal Challenge

Commitment should come in response to a personal challenge. Don't just hand someone a card and hope they sign. Look them in the eye and invite them to commit.

### 3. Time to Consider

Give people time to count the cost. Some will sign immediately; others need a few days to pray and discuss with family. Both are fine.

### 4. Clear Signing Moment

Create a meaningful moment when they sign. This isn't just paperwork—it's a covenant. Treat it with appropriate weight.

### 5. Welcome and Integration

Once signed, welcome them warmly into the Core Group. Introduce them, include them, give them work to do. Commitment leads immediately to belonging.

<Callout type="tip">
  Consider having new Core Group members share briefly at their first gathering—who they are, why they joined, what they're excited about. It honors their commitment and integrates them immediately.

## What If Someone Doesn't Follow Through?

Sometimes people sign commitment cards but don't fulfill their commitments. Here's how to handle it:

### Step 1: Notice Early

Pay attention. If someone starts missing gatherings or disengaging from assignments, notice it before it becomes a pattern.

### Step 2: Private Conversation

Have a one-on-one conversation. Lead with curiosity, not accusation:
- "I've noticed you've been absent lately. Is everything okay?"
- "How are you doing with your Core Group commitments?"

### Step 3: Reference the Commitment

If there's a gap between commitment and behavior, reference what they signed:
- "When you joined, you committed to [specific item]. What's making that difficult right now?"

### Step 4: Problem-Solve or Release

Either help them get back on track or graciously release them from the commitment:
- "What would help you re-engage?"
- "It sounds like this isn't the right fit right now. That's okay—no hard feelings."

Formalized commitment invites people to let their yes be yes—to make a clear, intentional commitment to the work God has called you to do together.
