Growth is the heartbeat of the Core Group phase. You need to build toward 50-100 committed adults before you can launch effectively. This doesn't happen by accident—it requires intentional strategy, consistent effort, and trust in God to bring the increase.

This guide covers proven strategies for growing your Core Group while maintaining the quality and unity essential for a healthy launch.

## The Growth Target

### Critical Mass: 50-100 Adults

This number isn't arbitrary. Research and experience show that launching with fewer than 50 adults creates significant challenges:

- Not enough people to staff children's ministry
- Worship feels thin and energy is low
- Financial base is inadequate
- Too few hands for setup, hospitality, and guest care
- Higher risk of early burnout

**The target is 100 adults.** 50 is the minimum. The more, the better.

  Don't rush to launch with an undersized Core Group. It's better to delay launch and build a strong foundation than to launch prematurely and struggle from day one.

## Growth Principle: Shared Ownership

The most critical factor in Core Group growth is **shared ownership**. The Core Group needs to own the responsibility with the Senior Pastor in building the Core Group numerically.

If only the Senior Pastor is inviting, growth plateaus. When every member actively invites, growth compounds.

### Why Shared Ownership Works

- More networks accessed
- More personal invitations extended
- More trust established (people trust their friends)
- More accountability for results
- More excitement as people bring their people

### Establishing Shared Ownership

Make it clear from the beginning:
- "Growing this group is everyone's job, not just mine."
- "You are all on the front line of building the Core Group."
- "If we all own this together, we'll reach our goal."

<Callout type="insight">
  The best Core Group members don't wait to be asked—they naturally invite because they're excited about what's happening. Your job is to cultivate that excitement and remove barriers to invitation.

## Growth Strategy: Vision Meeting Rhythm

Vision Meetings are your primary growth engine. A consistent rhythm of Vision Meetings, well-executed with strong invitation, produces steady growth.

### Recommended Rhythm

- **At minimum:** Every other week
- **During intensive growth:** Weekly or even multiple times per week

### Keys to Effective Vision Meeting Rhythm

1. **Consistency** — Same day/time creates predictability
2. **Variety** — Mix larger formal meetings with smaller informal gatherings
3. **Quality** — Every meeting executed against the 8 Critical Success Factors
4. **Follow-up** — Every attendee followed up within 48 hours

### Tracking Vision Meeting Results

| Meeting Date | Attendance | First-Timers | Core Group Additions |
|--------------|------------|--------------|---------------------|
| | | | |

Track results over time to identify trends and diagnose problems.

## Growth Strategy: Network Multiplication

Your Core Group's collective network is far larger than yours alone. Systematically access these networks.

### Step 1: Map Existing Networks

Have each Core Group member list:
- Friends who might be interested
- Family members in the area
- Colleagues from work
- Neighbors they know
- Former church connections
- Social connections (gym, clubs, kids' activities)

### Step 2: Prioritize Targets

Not everyone is equally likely to be interested. Prioritize:
- People who've expressed interest in spiritual things
- People in seasons of transition (new job, new baby, new city)
- People unhappy with their current church situation
- People known to be looking for community

### Step 3: Assign and Track

Each Core Group member should have specific people they're cultivating and inviting. Track progress:
- Who are you praying for this month?
- Who have you invited?
- What's the response?

---

## Growth Strategy: Setting Goals

Vague intentions produce vague results. Set specific, measurable goals.

### Individual Goals

Each Core Group member commits to:
- Invite at least **5 new people** to every Vision Meeting
- Bring at least **1 person or couple** to every meeting
- Have at least **3 invitation conversations** per week

### Group Goals

Track and celebrate as a group:
- Total invitations extended this month
- Total first-time Vision Meeting attendees
- Total new Core Group commitments

<Callout type="tip">
  What gets measured gets managed. Review goals regularly, celebrate wins publicly, and address shortfalls directly but graciously.
</Callout>

## Growth Strategy: Ask, Seek, Knock

Jesus taught this pattern for prayer, and it applies to Core Group building:

### Ask the Lord

- Pray specifically for God to raise up workers
- Ask for names and faces to come to mind
- Seek wisdom about who to approach and when

### Seek Them Out

- Be proactive—don't wait for people to find you
- Look for people whose hearts God is preparing
- Expand your own network intentionally

### Knock and Invite

- Make the invitation clear and direct
- Don't be afraid of rejection
- Follow up when people show interest

## Maintaining Quality While Growing

Growth for growth's sake isn't the goal. You want to grow with the right people—those who are **COMMITTED, COMPELLED, CONTAGIOUS, and COURAGEOUS**.

### Quality Control Mechanisms

**Vision Meeting screening:**
Not everyone who attends becomes Core Group. The follow-up interview process filters for fit.

**Commitment formalization:**
Requiring a signed commitment card ensures people understand and accept expectations before joining.

**Ongoing accountability:**
Core Group members who aren't fulfilling their assignments need direct conversation.

### When to Say No

Not everyone is right for the Core Group. Be willing to redirect people who:
- Aren't spiritually ready for this commitment
- Have significant unresolved issues
- Don't resonate with your distinctives
- Are looking to escape problems rather than build something

<Callout type="warning">
  A handful of wrong people can do more damage than their absence would. Protect the culture and unity of your Core Group by being discerning about who joins.
</Callout>

## Maintaining Unity While Growing

As the group grows, maintaining unity becomes more challenging. New people bring new dynamics, and the intimate early group evolves.

### Unity Strategies

**Consistent enculturation:**
Continue teaching distinctives and values. New members need the same foundation as founding members.

**Relationship building:**
Create opportunities for relationships across the group, not just within original friend clusters.

**Clear leadership:**
The Senior Pastor must maintain clear spiritual leadership. Growing groups need strong shepherding.

**Conflict management:**
Address issues early. Small problems become big problems when ignored.

### Signs of Unity Problems

- Cliques forming within the group
- Gossip or criticism circulating
- People quietly disengaging
- Resistance to new members being fully included

## Growth Phases

Expect growth to happen in phases, not linearly:

### Phase 1: Slow Start

The first few months often feel slow. You're learning, experimenting, and building initial momentum. Don't be discouraged.

### Phase 2: Acceleration

As Core Group members catch the vision and start inviting effectively, growth accelerates. This is when compound growth begins.

### Phase 3: Plateau

Growth often plateaus as obvious networks are exhausted. This requires renewed focus on expanding networks and improving Vision Meeting effectiveness.

### Phase 4: Push to Critical Mass

The final push to 50-100 adults requires sustained, intensive effort. This is when weekly Vision Meetings and aggressive invitation pay off.

<Callout type="insight">
  Growth is rarely steady. Expect seasons of rapid growth and seasons of plateau. Stay faithful in both, adjusting strategy as needed.
</Callout>

## When Growth Stalls

If your Core Group isn't growing, diagnose the problem:

### Check the Invitation Engine

- Are Core Group members actually inviting?
- Are enough people being invited to Vision Meetings?
- Are invitations personal or just mass communication?

### Check Vision Meeting Effectiveness

- Are people attending Vision Meetings?
- Are they expressing interest afterward?
- Is follow-up happening?

### Check the Core Group Experience

- Are Core Group members engaged and excited?
- Would they naturally invite friends?
- Is there unity and energy, or tension and fatigue?

### Possible Fixes

- Refocus on shared ownership of growth
- Set clearer goals with accountability
- Improve Vision Meeting execution
- Address any Core Group health issues
- Expand networks through intentional relationship building
