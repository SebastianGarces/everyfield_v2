Growing a Core Group isn't random—it follows a predictable funnel. Understanding this funnel helps you think strategically about where people are in their journey and what needs to happen next.

The funnel moves people from broad awareness to deep commitment through intentional stages.

## The Funnel Stages

```
         NETWORK
            ↓
      VISION MEETING
            ↓
        FOLLOW UP
            ↓
       CORE GROUP
            ↓
   BUILDING TOGETHER
```

Each stage narrows the group to those who are increasingly committed and aligned with the vision.

---

## Stage 1: Network

**Who:** Friends, acquaintances, social connections, Facebook friends, colleagues, neighbors, extended family, church connections—anyone in your sphere of influence.

**Size:** Potentially hundreds or thousands of people.

**Goal:** Identify potential Vision Meeting attendees and extend invitations.

At this stage, you're not asking for commitment. You're simply making people aware that something is happening and inviting them to learn more.

### Keys to Success

- Every Core Group member actively leverages their network
- Multiple invitation methods used (personal conversation, text, social media)
- Constant expansion through asking: "Who do you know who might be interested?"

<Callout type="tip">
  Your network is larger than you think. Most people underestimate how many potential invitees they have access to. Make a list—you'll be surprised.
</Callout>

---

## Stage 2: Vision Meeting

**Who:** People from your network who attend a Vision Meeting.

**Size:** 10-50+ per meeting, depending on format.

**Goal:** Cast vision, share distinctives, and call for commitment.

The Vision Meeting is where awareness becomes interest. People hear the vision, feel the energy, and begin considering whether this is something they want to be part of.

### What Happens Here

- Connect with people relationally
- Inform about history, values, and distinctives
- Cast a clear, compelling, challenging vision
- Answer questions
- Call for commitment
- Capture contact information

### Keys to Success

- Consistent meeting rhythm (at minimum every other week)
- Strong execution of the 8 Critical Success Factors
- Every meeting has a clear ask and defined next steps

---

## Stage 3: Follow Up

**Who:** People who attended a Vision Meeting and expressed interest.

**Size:** Smaller than attendance—those with genuine interest.

**Goal:** Answer questions, interview for fit, and personally challenge to commit.

This is where individuals become personal. You move from group presentation to one-on-one conversation. It's also where you filter—not everyone is the right fit.

### What Happens Here

- Timely outreach (within 48 hours of Vision Meeting)
- Personal phone calls or meetings
- Answering lingering questions
- Re-casting vision in personal context
- Interviewing for fit (maturity, gifts, chemistry, right reasons, season of life)
- Challenging appropriate candidates to commit

### Keys to Success

- Don't let follow-up slip—timing matters
- Have meaningful conversations, not just check-ins
- Be willing to have the hard conversation when someone isn't a fit
- Track everything in your database

<Callout type="important">
  Follow-up is where most growth dies. Great Vision Meetings with poor follow-up waste effort. Prioritize this stage ruthlessly.
</Callout>

---

## Stage 4: Core Group

**Who:** People who have committed to join and signed a commitment card.

**Size:** Building toward 50-100 adults.

**Goal:** Grow together, pray, give, and build the group.

At this stage, people have moved from interest to commitment. They're all in—attending gatherings, giving financially, inviting others, and preparing for what's ahead.

### What Happens Here

- Regular Core Group gatherings
- Enculturation in values and distinctives
- Corporate prayer
- Financial giving established
- Active invitation of others to Vision Meetings
- Emerging leadership identification

### Keys to Success

- Clear expectations from the beginning
- Meaningful gatherings that inspire and inform
- Accountability for the three primary assignments (grow, pray, give)
- Intentional relationship building within the group

---

## Stage 5: Building Together

**Who:** The entire Core Group working as a unified team.

**Size:** Full Core Group.

**Goal:** Prepare to transition to Launch Team and launch the church.

This stage represents the mature Core Group—a cohesive, unified, committed team ready to take on the hard work of launching a church.

### What Happens Here

- Leadership roles emerging
- Specific responsibilities assigned
- Increasing meeting frequency
- Preparation for transition to Launch Team
- Launch date discernment

## Funnel Metrics

Track these metrics to understand how your funnel is performing:

| Metric | What It Measures | Healthy Target |
|--------|------------------|----------------|
| **Invitations extended** | Network engagement | 5+ per member per meeting |
| **Vision Meeting attendance** | Invitation effectiveness | 30-40% of invited |
| **Follow-up completion** | Discipline in follow-up | 100% within 48 hours |
| **Conversion to Core Group** | Overall funnel effectiveness | 20-30% of Vision Meeting attendees |
| **Core Group retention** | Group health | 90%+ remaining committed |

<Callout type="insight">
  If your funnel is broken at any stage, everything downstream suffers. Diagnose where drop-off is happening and focus improvement there.
</Callout>

## Common Funnel Breakdowns

### Breakdown: Network Stage

**Symptom:** Not enough people attending Vision Meetings.

**Causes:**
- Core Group members not actively inviting
- Reliance on mass communication instead of personal invitation
- Limited networks being tapped

**Fix:** Refocus on the cardinal principle—everyone owns responsibility for growing the group. Set specific invitation goals and hold people accountable.

### Breakdown: Vision Meeting Stage

**Symptom:** People attend but don't express interest.

**Causes:**
- Weak presentation or unclear vision
- Poor meeting execution
- Wrong people attending

**Fix:** Evaluate against the 8 Critical Success Factors. Get feedback. Improve your presentation and close.

### Breakdown: Follow-Up Stage

**Symptom:** Interested people never commit.

**Causes:**
- Delayed or missing follow-up
- Superficial conversations that don't address real questions
- No personal challenge to commit

**Fix:** Systematize follow-up within 48 hours. Train yourself and team in meaningful follow-up conversations. Always make the ask.

### Breakdown: Core Group Stage

**Symptom:** Members disengage or leave.

**Causes:**
- Unclear expectations
- Boring or purposeless gatherings
- Relational disconnection
- Lack of ownership

**Fix:** Clarify expectations, improve gatherings, build relationships intentionally, and give people meaningful work to do.

## Working the Funnel

Your ongoing work is to keep people moving through the funnel:

1. **Expand the network** — Always be meeting new people and asking for referrals
2. **Fill Vision Meetings** — Consistent rhythm with strong attendance
3. **Execute follow-up** — Disciplined, timely, personal conversations
4. **Strengthen Core Group** — Meaningful gatherings that keep people engaged and growing
5. **Monitor metrics** — Know your numbers and diagnose problems early

The funnel never stops. Even after your Core Group is strong, you continue Vision Meetings to add new members right up to launch.
