The Core Group is the heartbeat of your church plant. Before there are Sunday services, before there's a worship team, before there's a building—there's the Core Group. These are the people who will stand with you, pray with you, give sacrificially, and work tirelessly to bring the vision to life.

Understanding what a Core Group is—and what it requires—shapes everything that follows.

## Definition

A Core Group is a committed team of believers who have embraced the vision of the church plant and have committed to building it together with the Senior Pastor.

They are not spectators. They are not consumers. They are builders.

<Callout type="insight">
  Think of the Core Group as the founding members—the people whose names will be remembered when the story of this church is told. They're investing when there's nothing tangible to see, believing God for what doesn't yet exist.

## The 4 C's: Who You're Looking For

Not everyone who attends a Vision Meeting belongs in the Core Group. You're looking for a specific kind of person—people who embody the 4 C's:

### COMMITTED

Core Group members are fully dedicated to the vision and mission. They prioritize this work above other good things. Their commitment isn't casual—it's covenantal.

**What commitment looks like:**
- Regular attendance at Core Group gatherings
- Financial giving even before the church launches
- Protecting time for the work of building the church
- Following through on assignments and responsibilities

### COMPELLED

Core Group members are driven by conviction, not convenience. They're not joining because it's easy or because they have nothing better to do. They're compelled by a sense of calling—this is where God wants them.

**What compulsion looks like:**
- A sense that God has led them to this specific church plant
- Growing excitement about the vision over time
- Willingness to sacrifice comfort for the mission
- Internal motivation that doesn't require external pressure

### CONTAGIOUS

Core Group members have enthusiasm that spreads to others. They can't help talking about what God is doing. Their excitement draws others in and creates momentum.

**What contagiousness looks like:**
- Naturally inviting others to Vision Meetings
- Sharing the vision in everyday conversations
- Positive energy that affects the group dynamic
- Ability to articulate why this church matters

### COURAGEOUS

Core Group members are willing to take risks and step out in faith. Church planting involves uncertainty, and they're willing to embrace it. They don't wait until everything is guaranteed before committing.

**What courage looks like:**
- Giving financially before there's a track record
- Serving before there are defined roles
- Staying committed when things get hard
- Speaking up and stepping into leadership

<Callout type="important">
  You're not looking for perfect people. You're looking for people with these qualities in seed form—people who have potential and willingness, even if they're still growing.

## Why the Core Group Matters

The Core Group determines everything about your launch. Here's why:

### 1. Critical Mass

You need 50-100 committed adults to launch effectively. These people come from the Core Group. Without a strong Core Group, you don't have enough people to run children's ministry, host guests, lead worship, and create the energy of a thriving church.

### 2. Financial Foundation

Most of your pre-launch funding comes from the Core Group's generosity. The people who believe in the vision before it exists are the ones who give to make it happen.

### 3. Ministry Leadership

Every key leader on your Launch Team emerges from the Core Group. Your worship leader, children's ministry director, facilities coordinator—they're all Core Group members who step into greater responsibility.

### 4. Cultural DNA

The Core Group establishes the culture of the church. Their values, their warmth, their authenticity—these become the DNA that shapes how guests experience your church for years to come.

### 5. Shared Ownership

When the Core Group owns the vision alongside you, you're not alone. The weight of building the church is shared. The work is distributed. The prayer is multiplied.

## Core Group vs. Launch Team

These terms are related but distinct:

| Core Group | Launch Team |
|------------|-------------|
| Forming from the beginning | Emerges when launch date is set |
| Focus: Growing the group | Focus: Preparing for launch |
| Primary activity: Vision Meetings | Primary activity: Training |
| Success metric: Size and commitment | Success metric: Readiness |

The Core Group becomes the Launch Team when you set a launch date. At that point, the mission shifts from growing the group to preparing for opening day.

<Callout type="tip">
  Don't rush the transition. A Core Group that transitions to Launch Team too early will be underdeveloped and under-resourced. Build the Core Group thoroughly before shifting focus.
</Callout>

## What Core Group Members Commit To

Before someone joins the Core Group, they should understand and accept these commitments:

### Prayer

Planting a church is a spiritual work. Core Group members commit to regular, fervent prayer—individually and corporately.

### Giving

Core Group members give generously, faithfully, sacrificially, and joyfully. This isn't about amounts—it's about hearts committed to funding the vision.

### Growing the Group

Every Core Group member owns responsibility for building the Core Group numerically. This means inviting people to Vision Meetings, having conversations about the church, and leveraging their networks.

### Attendance

Core Group members show up consistently—to Vision Meetings, Core Group gatherings, training events, and eventually Launch Team meetings.

### Unity

Core Group members commit to maintaining unity with the Senior Pastor and each other. Disagreements are handled privately and constructively, not through gossip or division.

---

## The Core Group Journey

The Core Group isn't static—it develops through distinct phases:

### Formation Phase

Initial members join. The group is small, meetings are intimate, and relationships are forming. Focus: casting vision and building chemistry.

### Growth Phase

Numbers increase as Vision Meetings bear fruit. The group takes on its own identity. Focus: continual invitation and beginning to enculturate new members.

### Development Phase

Leadership begins to emerge. Members take on specific responsibilities. Focus: identifying gifts and deploying people.

### Transition Phase

The launch date is set, and the Core Group becomes the Launch Team. Focus shifts from growing the group to preparing for launch.

## Common Core Group Challenges

### Challenge: Growth Plateau

The group stops growing because members stop inviting.

**Solution:** Revisit the cardinal principle—every member is responsible for growing the group. Set goals, track progress, celebrate wins.

### Challenge: Passenger Mentality

Some members attend but don't actively contribute.

**Solution:** Have direct conversations about expectations. Not everyone is meant to be in the Core Group—some may need to step back until they're ready to fully engage.

### Challenge: Lack of Unity

Disagreements or personality conflicts disrupt the group.

**Solution:** Address issues early and directly. The Senior Pastor must shepherd the group, not ignore relational problems.

### Challenge: Premature Launch

Pressure to launch before the Core Group is adequately developed.

**Solution:** Trust the process. A premature launch is worse than a delayed one. Keep building until you have critical mass of the right people.

<Callout type="warning">
  It's better to delay your launch with a strong Core Group than to launch on time with a weak one. The Core Group determines your starting point—and it's very hard to recover from a weak start.

The Core Group is not just a team—it's a community of believers encouraging one another toward the great work of building Christ's church.
