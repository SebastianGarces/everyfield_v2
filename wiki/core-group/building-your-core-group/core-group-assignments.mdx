Every Core Group member has work to do. This isn't a club to join—it's a team with a mission. Understanding the assignments clearly helps members know exactly what's expected and empowers them to contribute meaningfully.

These assignments define what Core Group membership actually means in practice.

## The Three Primary Assignments

As the Core Group grows during the vision stage, each member has three primary assignments that must be embraced by every person:

### 1. GROW THE CORE GROUP

**This is the most critical assignment.** Every member is on the front line of growing the Core Group. Each person must feel the weight of this responsibility.

<Callout type="important">
  Building the Core Group is job number one for every Core Group member. Not just the Senior Pastor. Not just the most outgoing members. Everyone.
</Callout>

**What this looks like:**

- Using your sphere of influence to identify potential members
- Asking the Lord to direct you to those whose hearts He is preparing
- Actively seeking out and inviting others to Vision Meetings
- Setting personal invitation goals and following through
- Celebrating when someone you invited joins the Core Group

**This is why we seek COMMITTED, COMPELLED, CONTAGIOUS, and COURAGEOUS members.** People with these qualities naturally share what excites them. They can't help but talk about what God is doing.

### 2. PRAY

Planting a church is the work of God—only He can build the church. Each member must own responsibility for fervently and faithfully calling out to the Lord for His work.

**What this looks like:**

- Daily personal prayer for the church plant
- Praying specifically for other Core Group members
- Praying for people you've invited or are cultivating
- Participating in corporate times of prayer
- Fasting as led by the Spirit

**Corporate prayer is essential.** Schedule regular times for the Core Group to gather specifically for prayer—seeking the Lord together for His direction, provision, and blessing.

### 3. GIVE

The primary funding for the church plant comes through the Core Group. There's no outside organization writing checks—God's provision flows through the generosity of His people.

**What this looks like:**

- Giving generously — beyond what's comfortable
- Giving faithfully — consistently, not sporadically
- Giving sacrificially — it costs something
- Giving joyfully — not out of guilt or obligation

<Callout type="insight">
  Financial giving in the Core Group stage demonstrates faith. You're investing in something that doesn't yet exist, believing God for what's to come. This kind of giving shapes hearts and funds the mission.
</Callout>

## Why These Three?

These assignments work together to create a healthy, growing Core Group:

| Assignment | What It Builds |
|------------|----------------|
| **Grow** | Numerical strength for launch |
| **Pray** | Spiritual foundation and unity |
| **Give** | Financial resources and commitment |

A Core Group that grows but doesn't pray lacks spiritual power. A Core Group that prays but doesn't give lacks resources. A Core Group that gives but doesn't grow will be too small to launch effectively.

All three are essential.

## Additional Responsibilities

As the Core Group develops, the Senior Pastor will identify and assign additional responsibilities to specific members based on their gifts, experience, and calling.

### Handling of Monies

**What it requires:**
- Impeccable integrity and trustworthiness
- Attention to detail
- Ability to maintain confidentiality
- Basic understanding of financial processes

**Responsibilities include:**
- Collecting offerings during Core Group gatherings
- Counting and recording contributions
- Preparing bank deposits
- Maintaining accurate records
- Handling finances above reproach

<Callout type="warning">
  Handle finances impeccably and above reproach from day one. Look for one or two qualified individuals to share this responsibility—never rely on just one person.
</Callout>

### Worship Site Location

**What it requires:**
- Community connections
- Real estate knowledge (helpful but not required)
- Research and organizational skills
- Persistence and patience

**Responsibilities include:**
- Researching potential worship locations
- Making initial contact with facilities
- Gathering information on costs, availability, requirements
- Reporting findings to Senior Pastor
- Helping negotiate terms

Finding a place to meet is critical and time-consuming. Assemble a site selection task force soon after the Core Group begins forming. Good candidates include people connected in the community or involved in local real estate.

### Launch Coordinator

**What it requires:**
- Proven project management skills
- Organizational gifting
- Ability to work collaboratively
- Willingness to work under the Senior Pastor's leadership

**Responsibilities include:**
- Owning the launch process
- Building and managing the project timeline
- Coordinating between ministry areas
- Tracking milestones and deadlines
- Keeping the launch on schedule and budget

<Callout type="tip">
  Finding a great project coordinator is one of the most important early decisions. Many Senior Pastors lack the gifting for detailed project management—the right Launch Coordinator fills that gap perfectly.
</Callout>

## Assigning Responsibilities Wisely

Not every Core Group member is ready for additional responsibilities immediately. Consider:

### Timing

- Let people demonstrate faithfulness in the three primary assignments first
- Don't overload new members before they've settled in
- Match responsibilities to the development stage of the Core Group

### Gifting

- Observe natural abilities and spiritual gifts
- Ask about past experience and professional skills
- Match assignments to people's strengths, not just availability

### Capacity

- Consider what else is going on in their lives
- Don't burn out your best people with too much responsibility
- Leave margin for the primary assignments

### Growth Potential

- Some assignments develop leaders
- Consider who you're developing for future roles
- Match current responsibility with future trajectory

## Accountability for Assignments

Setting clear expectations is only half the work. Following up is equally important.

### For the Three Primary Assignments

**Build in regular check-ins:**
- "How many people have you invited this month?"
- "What are you praying for specifically?"
- "How is your giving going—any challenges I can help with?"

**Celebrate wins:**
- Acknowledge when someone brings a guest
- Share answered prayers with the group
- Thank givers (without disclosing amounts)

**Address shortfalls:**
- Have private conversations when someone isn't engaging
- Clarify expectations without being harsh
- Help people identify barriers and work through them

### For Additional Responsibilities

**Establish clear deliverables:**
- What exactly needs to be accomplished?
- What are the deadlines?
- What resources are available?

**Create regular reporting:**
- Weekly or bi-weekly check-ins
- Written updates for larger projects
- Clear escalation path for problems

## When Members Aren't Engaging

Not everyone who joins the Core Group will fully engage with the assignments. Handle this carefully but directly.

### Step 1: Private Conversation

Meet one-on-one. Ask questions before assuming:
- "How are things going?"
- "I've noticed [specific observation]. What's going on?"
- "Is something making this difficult right now?"

### Step 2: Clarify Expectations

If there's confusion about expectations, clarify them:
- "Here's what Core Group membership involves..."
- "This is what we're asking of everyone..."
- "Does this still feel like the right fit for you?"

### Step 3: Offer Support

If external circumstances are creating barriers:
- "How can we help?"
- "What would make this more doable?"
- "Let's problem-solve together."

### Step 4: If Necessary, Release

Some people aren't ready for Core Group commitment. It's better to release them graciously than to carry passengers:
- "It sounds like this isn't the right season for Core Group involvement."
- "No hard feelings—we'd love to have you at Vision Meetings when you're ready."
- "Let's stay connected."

Every member of the Core Group has been given gifts and resources to contribute. The assignments give structure to that contribution, ensuring the whole body works together effectively.
