Core Group meetings are different from Vision Meetings. Vision Meetings are designed to attract and recruit new members. Core Group meetings are designed to develop and unify existing members.

Understanding this distinction—and structuring your gatherings accordingly—makes all the difference.

## Meeting Frequency

As the Core Group coalesces, meet as a group regularly—typically twice a month during the early months, becoming more frequent as you approach launch.

### Recommended Rhythm

| Phase | Frequency | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **Early formation** | Twice monthly | Build relationships, establish culture |
| **Growth phase** | Twice monthly + Vision Meetings | Continue building while recruiting |
| **Pre-launch** | Weekly | Intensive preparation and training |

<Callout type="warning">
  Don't peak too early. This is a lengthy process requiring sustained effort. If you burn people out with too many meetings early on, you won't have energy left for the intensive pre-launch phase.
</Callout>

## Two Primary Leadership Objectives

Every Core Group meeting should accomplish two objectives:

### 1. INSPIRE — Cast Vision

Continually reinforce the vision of the church and what God has called you to. Remind the group afresh of who God is—renewed by His greatness, transcendence, and awesome attributes.

**Accomplish this through:**
- Worship (singing, Scripture, prayer)
- Teaching that elevates God's character and purposes
- Sharing stories of what God is doing
- Casting vision of what's ahead

**Why this matters:**
People forget. The pressures of life crowd out the vision. If you don't continually refresh their sense of calling and God's greatness, motivation fades. Great leaders constantly cast vision of future days, events, and fruitfulness.

### 2. INSTILL — Enculturate the Team

Thoroughly enculturate members in the values, distinctives, and DNA of the church. When people catch the vision and resonate with the values, great energy, joy, and momentum is produced.

**Accomplish this through:**
- Teaching on the 4 Pillars
- Explaining Worship/Walk/Work
- Walking through the Ministry Funnel
- Discussing what Sundays will look like
- Visiting existing churches in the network
- Attending training events together

**Why this matters:**
There's great power in alignment. A Core Group where everyone deeply understands and embraces the values is far more effective than one where people are just along for the ride. Enculturation creates ownership.

<Callout type="insight">
  Enculturation isn't brainwashing—it's alignment. You want people who genuinely resonate with your values, not people who just comply. Teaching creates opportunities for questions, discussion, and deeper buy-in.
</Callout>

## Standard Meeting Format

Here's a template for a typical Core Group gathering:

### Opening: Cast Vision (30-40 minutes)

**Renew people's vision of the Living God:**
- Open with worship (singing, prayer, Scripture)
- Brief devotional focused on God's character or promises
- Prayer together—both thanksgiving and intercession

**Remind them why we are planting this church:**
- Share updates on what God is doing
- Celebrate answered prayers and wins
- Cast vision for what's ahead

### Main Content: Enculturate Team (30-40 minutes)

**Teaching on distinctives and values:**
- The 4 Pillars
- Worship/Walk/Work model
- Ministry Funnel
- Specific doctrinal distinctives
- What Sundays will look like

**Other enculturation activities:**
- Discuss visits to other churches in the network
- Debrief training events attended
- Share stories from the broader movement

### Closing: Update and Next Steps (15-20 minutes)

**Business and logistics:**
- Upcoming Vision Meeting details
- Assignments and responsibilities
- Calendar updates
- Prayer requests

**Close in prayer:**
- Pray for specific needs in the group
- Pray for upcoming Vision Meeting
- Pray for people being invited and cultivated

## Teaching Rotation

Over the course of Core Group development, systematically cover key content:

### Foundational Topics

- [ ] The 4 Pillars (may take 2-3 sessions)
- [ ] Worship/Walk/Work model
- [ ] Ministry Funnel explained
- [ ] What Sunday mornings will look like
- [ ] Core values and distinctives
- [ ] Doctrinal overview

### Vision Topics

- [ ] Why this church, this community, this time
- [ ] Goals for launch and first year
- [ ] What success looks like
- [ ] The journey ahead

### Practical Topics

- [ ] Core Group assignments explained
- [ ] Invitation strategies training
- [ ] Follow-up best practices
- [ ] Financial stewardship

<Callout type="tip">
  Create a teaching calendar so you cover everything systematically. Don't let Core Group meetings become aimless or repetitive. Each gathering should build on the last.

## Making Meetings Meaningful

The worst thing you can do is make Core Group meetings feel like obligations. Here's how to make them something people look forward to:

### Create Community

- Build in fellowship time (food helps!)
- Vary locations occasionally
- Celebrate birthdays, milestones, answered prayers
- Know people's names, stories, and struggles

### Encourage Participation

- Include discussion questions, not just lectures
- Let people share their own stories and insights
- Rotate who leads prayer or other elements
- Create space for questions

### Value Their Time

- Start and end on time
- Have a clear agenda and stick to it
- Make every minute count
- Don't waste time on things that could be an email

### Keep It Fresh

- Vary the format occasionally
- Bring in guest speakers or videos
- Change locations for special gatherings
- Plan occasional social events separate from meetings

---

## When to Add Elements

As your Core Group grows and develops, add additional elements:

### Early Phase (5-15 members)

- Focus on relationship building
- Intimate gatherings, lots of discussion
- Teaching happens but so does getting to know each other

### Growth Phase (15-30 members)

- More structure needed
- Breakout discussions for deeper conversation
- Begin identifying potential leaders

### Mature Phase (30+ members)

- Consider adding specific ministry team meetings
- Leadership huddles may be needed
- Pre-launch training begins overlapping with regular meetings

## Avoiding Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall: All Business, No Heart

If meetings become only logistics and updates, people disengage.

**Fix:** Always start with worship and vision casting. Keep the spiritual foundation strong.

### Pitfall: All Heart, No Substance

If meetings are emotionally warm but never teach anything, people don't grow.

**Fix:** Plan intentional teaching content. Move people deeper in understanding.

### Pitfall: Dominated by a Few

If the same people always talk and participate, others check out.

**Fix:** Intentionally draw out quieter members. Use small group discussion. Rotate leadership of elements.

### Pitfall: Running Long

If meetings consistently run over, people stop coming or come resentfully.

**Fix:** Plan carefully, watch the clock, and end on time. People can stay and talk if they want to.

The early church gathered with purpose—teaching, fellowship, communion, and prayer. Your Core Group meetings follow the same pattern, building the foundation for the church to come.
