Running effective Vision Meetings requires the right tools and materials. A well-prepared Vision Meeting Kit ensures you're never caught scrambling for supplies or apologizing for missing materials.

This guide covers everything you need to assemble a complete kit that you can grab and go.

## Why a Prepared Kit Matters

Having a dedicated Vision Meeting Kit accomplishes several things:

- **Eliminates last-minute scrambling** — Everything is ready before you need it
- **Ensures consistency** — Every meeting has the same professional materials
- **Reduces stress** — You can focus on people instead of logistics
- **Projects professionalism** — Preparedness communicates you take this seriously

<Callout type="tip">
  Designate a Core Group member as the "Kit Keeper" who ensures the kit is complete, organized, and transported to every Vision Meeting. This frees you to focus on preparation and people.

## Printed Materials Deep Dive

### Guest Sign-in Sheet

Your sign-in sheet should capture essential information without feeling like an interrogation.

**Include:**
- Name
- Email address
- Phone number
- How they heard about tonight's meeting

**Format tips:**
- Large enough to write comfortably
- Clear headings
- Space for 15-20 names per sheet
- Your church logo at the top

### Response Card

The response card is how you gauge interest and know how to follow up.

**Include:**
- Name (pre-filled if possible)
- Interest level checkboxes:
  - "I'd like more information"
  - "I'm interested in joining the Core Group"
  - "I'm ready to commit"
  - "This isn't for me right now"
- Questions or concerns (open field)
- Best way to contact them

<Callout type="important">
  Make it easy for people to indicate they're not interested. Paradoxically, this makes people more willing to fill out the card honestly. You want accurate information, not polite pretenses.
</Callout>

### Welcome Brochure

A take-home piece that summarizes what you shared.

**Include:**
- Church name and mission statement
- Brief version of your story
- Core values and distinctives
- Contact information and website
- Upcoming meeting dates

**Design tips:**
- Professional quality paper and printing
- Consistent branding with banners and signage
- Compelling photos or graphics
- QR code linking to more information

## Technology Preparation

### Before Every Meeting

1. **Test your presentation** on the actual equipment you'll use
2. **Verify videos play** with sound working properly
3. **Charge all batteries** (speakers, clicker, laptop)
4. **Load backup onto flash drive** in case of laptop failure

### Have a Backup Plan

Technology fails at the worst times. Know what you'll do if:

- The projector doesn't work → Printed handouts of key slides
- Audio fails → Speak louder, skip videos, or use phone speaker
- Laptop dies → Flash drive with presentation ready for another computer
- Internet is needed but unavailable → All content stored locally

<Callout type="warning">
  Never assume technology will work. Test everything at the venue before guests arrive. Have a plan B for every piece of equipment.

## Building Your Kit Over Time

You don't need everything on day one. Build your kit strategically:

### Phase 1: Essentials

Start with what you absolutely must have:
- Sign-in sheets
- Name tags
- Pens
- Response cards
- Your laptop with presentation

### Phase 2: Professional

Add items that increase professionalism:
- Printed brochures
- Business cards
- Banner stands
- Portable speakers

### Phase 3: Complete

Round out with convenience items:
- Rolling case for transport
- Organized boxes with labels
- Backup technology
- Extra supplies

<Callout type="tip">
  Ask Core Group members to contribute specific items. One person provides clipboards, another prints brochures, another donates pens. It builds ownership and spreads the cost.
