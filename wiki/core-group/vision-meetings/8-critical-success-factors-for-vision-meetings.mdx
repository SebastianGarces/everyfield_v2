Not all Vision Meetings are created equal. Some produce a steady stream of committed Core Group members. Others leave you wondering why attendance keeps dropping and commitments stay flat.

The difference comes down to eight critical success factors. Master these, and your Vision Meetings become a powerful engine for growth. Neglect them, and you'll spin your wheels wondering what went wrong.

## 1. Great Attendance

The first critical factor is simple: people need to show up. A Vision Meeting with the right people in attendance has completely different energy than one with empty chairs.

**Who owns this responsibility?**

Both the Core Group and the Senior Pastor own the responsibility of inviting and delivering a steady stream of new people. This cannot be delegated to one person or left to chance.

<Callout type="important">
  Building the Core Group is job number one for every Core Group member. If your existing members aren't consistently bringing new people, your growth will plateau.
</Callout>

**What "great attendance" looks like:**

- Core Group members each bring at least one new person or couple
- Members leverage their networks, not just the Senior Pastor's
- A mix of brand new faces and people who've attended before
- People who are genuinely seeking, not just doing a favor

The people you attract must have the potential to become **COMMITTED, COMPELLED, CONTAGIOUS, and COURAGEOUS**. Quality matters as much as quantity.

## 2. An Acceptable Location

Where you hold your Vision Meeting shapes how people perceive the church you're planting. A poor location creates unnecessary barriers.

**What makes a location acceptable:**

- **Easy to find** — Clear directions, good signage, not confusing to navigate
- **Welcoming atmosphere** — Clean, comfortable, appropriately sized for your group
- **Conducive for both mingling and hearing** — Space for fellowship before/after and good acoustics for the presentation
- **Free from distractions** — No competing noise, interruptions, or awkward arrangements

<Callout type="tip">
  Scout your location in advance. Sit where attendees will sit. Can you hear clearly? Is the seating comfortable? Is the space too big (feels empty) or too small (feels cramped)?
</Callout>

**Common location options:**

- Living rooms (intimate, personal)
- Church fellowship halls (neutral, professional)
- Community center meeting rooms (accessible, affordable)
- Restaurant private rooms (convenient, casual)

Match your location to the size and formality of the meeting you're planning.

## 3. Great Logistics

Details matter. When logistics are handled poorly, people notice. When they're handled well, people don't notice—but they feel comfortable and cared for.

**Logistics checklist:**

- [ ] Room ready before the first guest arrives
- [ ] AV equipment set up and tested (no fumbling with technology during the meeting)
- [ ] Seating arranged appropriately
- [ ] Signage and banners properly placed
- [ ] Sign-in station visible and accessible
- [ ] Nametags prepared
- [ ] Handouts organized and ready
- [ ] Food and drinks prepared (if applicable)
- [ ] Greeters trained and positioned

**The 30-minute rule:** Arrive at least 30 minutes before the scheduled start time. Everything should be ready so you can focus on greeting people, not scrambling with setup.

---

## 4. A Clear Agenda

Winging it communicates that you haven't thought carefully about the meeting. A clear agenda communicates professionalism and respect for people's time.

**Your agenda should be:**

- Planned out in detail and written down
- Designed to start on time and end on time
- Balanced with sufficient time for introduction, presentation, Q&A, and close

| Element | Time Allocation |
|---------|-----------------|
| Meet and Greet, Sign-in | 15 minutes |
| Ice Breaker, Introduction | 15 minutes |
| Presentation | 30 minutes |
| Q&A | 30 minutes |
| Strong Close | 15 minutes |
| Fellowship/Food | 30 minutes |

<Callout type="tip">
  Practice your presentation with a timer. Know exactly how long each section takes so you can adjust in real-time without rushing or dragging.
</Callout>

## 5. A Great Vibe

The atmosphere of your Vision Meeting tells people what your church will feel like. If the meeting feels cold and formal, they'll expect a cold and formal church. If it feels warm and welcoming, they'll expect the same on Sunday mornings.

**Creating the right vibe:**

- **Warm and inviting** — Smile. Make eye contact. Use people's names.
- **Sense of community** — Core Group members should mingle with guests, not cluster together
- **Spirit of genuine friendliness** — Not salesy enthusiasm, but authentic warmth
- **Contagious enthusiasm** — Your excitement about the vision should be evident without being forced

**The temperature check:** After your next Vision Meeting, ask yourself: Would I want to come back based on how I was treated tonight?

---

## 6. A Compelling Message

This is the heart of the Vision Meeting. You're not just sharing information—you're casting a vision that could change people's lives.

**Elements of a compelling message:**

- **Vision presented clearly** — People should understand what you're trying to accomplish
- **Vision presented compellingly** — People should feel drawn to be part of it
- **Clear picture** — Use visual aids (PowerPoint, videos) effectively
- **Strong communication skills** — Practice until your delivery is confident and engaging
- **Concise** — Don't ramble. Every word should serve a purpose.

<Callout type="insight">
  The goal isn't to tell people everything about the church. The goal is to tell them enough that they want to learn more and consider joining.
</Callout>

**What to include:**

- Your personal story and calling
- The distinctives and values of the church
- The vision for what God will accomplish
- Why this church, in this place, at this time

---

## 7. A Strong Close

How you end the meeting matters as much as how you begin it. A weak close wastes the momentum you've built. A strong close moves people toward commitment.

**Components of a strong close:**

- **Motivate** — Remind people why this matters and what's at stake
- **Call the right people** — Be clear about who you're looking for
- **Genuine and non-manipulative** — Don't pressure; invite
- **Clear call to action** — What specifically do you want them to do next?

**The ask:** Don't be afraid to ask people to commit. Many people are waiting to be asked. A direct, genuine invitation often makes the difference between "interested" and "committed."

<Callout type="warning">
  A strong close is not manipulative or high-pressure. It's clear, direct, and honest. People should feel invited, not trapped.
</Callout>

---

## 8. Clear Next Steps

People who leave your Vision Meeting unsure of what to do next will often do nothing. Remove that barrier by making the next steps crystal clear.

**Before the meeting ends:**

- Dates for next meetings, trainings, and get-togethers are determined
- Calendar is in writing and ready to distribute
- Specific actions are assigned (e.g., "Fill out the response card," "Attend the follow-up coffee")
- Contact information has been collected from everyone

**The calendar test:** Can everyone who attended tell a friend exactly what happens next and when? If not, your next steps weren't clear enough.

---

## Putting It All Together

These eight factors work together. Great attendance means nothing if the message isn't compelling. A compelling message is wasted if there's no clear next step. Strong logistics set the stage for everything else.

**Self-assessment after each Vision Meeting:**

| Factor | Rating (1-5) | Notes for Improvement |
|--------|--------------|----------------------|
| Great Attendance | | |
| Acceptable Location | | |
| Great Logistics | | |
| Clear Agenda | | |
| Great Vibe | | |
| Compelling Message | | |
| Strong Close | | |
| Clear Next Steps | | |

Review this after every Vision Meeting. Identify your weakest area and focus on improving it for the next meeting.
