You've planned the meeting, invited the guests, and prepared your materials. Now it's time to execute. This guide walks you through running an effective Vision Meeting, from the moment you arrive to the last guest leaving.

---

## Arrival and Setup

### Getting There Early

Arrive at least 30 minutes before the scheduled start time. This gives you time to:

- Set up the room without rushing
- Test all technology
- Brief your team
- Collect yourself mentally and spiritually
- Pray over the space and the people coming

<Callout type="important">
  If you're rushing when the first guest arrives, you've already lost. Early arrival is non-negotiable.
</Callout>

### Room Setup Checklist

Work systematically through setup:

- [ ] Seating arranged (appropriate for expected attendance)
- [ ] Banners and signage positioned
- [ ] Sign-in table ready near entrance
- [ ] Name tags and pens laid out
- [ ] Handouts organized and accessible
- [ ] Projector/screen tested and focused
- [ ] Audio tested from multiple seats
- [ ] Presentation loaded and cued
- [ ] Food/refreshments ready (if applicable)
- [ ] Temperature comfortable

### Team Briefing

Gather your Core Group team for a quick briefing:

1. **Review assignments** — Who's greeting? Who's handling sign-in? Who's working the room?
2. **Set expectations** — "Let's make sure every guest feels welcomed and engaged"
3. **Address any concerns** — Last-minute questions or issues
4. **Pray together** — Ask God to work through this gathering

---

## As Guests Arrive

The first few minutes shape the entire experience. Make them count.

### The Greeting Station

Position your warmest, most welcoming people at the door:

- Greet everyone by name if you know them
- Introduce yourself if you don't
- Direct them to sign-in
- Offer a name tag
- Hand them any materials
- Introduce them to someone in the room

### Sign-In Process

Make sign-in quick and painless:

- Friendly person manning the table (not buried in paperwork)
- Clear instructions: "Just your name, email, and phone number"
- Pen that works
- Brief explanation: "We'll use this to follow up with more information"

### Working the Room

Core Group members should be mingling, not clustering:

- Each Core Group member engages with at least one guest
- Make introductions: "Have you met Sarah? Sarah, this is John—he's in real estate too."
- Keep conversations light: "How do you know [inviter]?" "What brought you out tonight?"
- Watch for wallflowers and engage them

<Callout type="tip">
  Assign specific Core Group members to be "floaters" whose only job is to engage anyone who looks disconnected. No guest should feel invisible.
</Callout>

---

## Opening the Meeting

Transition from mingling to the formal meeting with intentionality.

### The Call to Attention

- Give a 2-minute warning: "We'll get started in a couple minutes, grab your seat"
- Dim the lights slightly or adjust the room
- Move to the front and wait for attention
- Begin with warmth: "Good evening, everyone. Thank you for being here."

### The Welcome

Keep it brief but warm:

- Thank people for coming
- Acknowledge how busy everyone is
- Express genuine excitement about the gathering
- Preview what's coming: "Tonight you'll hear about what we're building and how you might be part of it"

### The Ice Breaker

Execute your planned ice breaker with energy:

- Give clear instructions
- Model participation if needed
- Keep it moving (don't let it drag)
- Laugh and be human

Example: "Let's go around the room. Share your name and one thing you're passionate about outside of work. I'll start—I'm John, and I'm passionate about hiking in the mountains."

## Delivering Your Presentation

This is the heart of the meeting. Everything has built to this moment.

### Managing Your Nerves

Everyone gets nervous. Channel it productively:

- Take a deep breath before you begin
- Remember: these people want you to succeed
- Focus on serving them, not impressing them
- Trust your preparation

### Presentation Mechanics

**Eye contact:**
- Look at individuals, not the room in general
- Sweep the room, connecting with different sections
- Don't stare at your slides or notes

**Voice:**
- Speak louder than feels natural
- Vary your tone and pace
- Pause for emphasis
- Don't rush

**Movement:**
- Use the space (don't stand frozen)
- Move toward people when making key points
- Gesture naturally
- Don't pace nervously

**Slides:**
- Advance slides smoothly (practice with clicker)
- Don't read slides verbatim
- Use slides to support, not replace, your message
- Look at the audience, not the screen

<Callout type="insight">
  The most compelling presentations feel like conversations, not lectures. You're sharing something you care deeply about with people you want to join you. Let that genuine enthusiasm come through.
</Callout>

### Handling Disruptions

Things happen. Handle them gracefully:

**Technology failure:**
- Stay calm: "Technology keeping us humble!"
- Pivot to your backup plan
- Keep going without missing a beat

**Late arrivals:**
- Acknowledge briefly with a smile
- Have someone quietly hand them materials
- Don't restart or over-explain

**Crying baby/noise:**
- Pause briefly if needed
- Continue without commentary
- Let parents handle it

**Difficult questions mid-presentation:**
- "Great question—let's hold that for Q&A so I can give it proper attention"

---

## Question and Answer

Q&A is where you address concerns and move people toward commitment.

### Setting Up Q&A

Transition smoothly from presentation:

- "I've shared a lot tonight. Now I want to hear from you."
- "What questions do you have? Nothing is off limits."

If silence follows:

- Wait patiently (count to 10 in your head)
- Have a Core Group member ready with a seed question
- Ask the room: "What resonated with you? What made you curious?"

### Answering Questions Well

**Listen fully:**
- Let them finish before responding
- Repeat or paraphrase to confirm understanding
- "So what you're asking is..."

**Answer directly:**
- Don't be evasive or overly lengthy
- If you don't know, say so: "I don't know, but I'll find out and follow up with you"
- Be honest about challenges and unknowns

**Stay balanced:**
- Avoid letting one person dominate
- "Let me get to a few other questions, and we can continue this conversation afterward"

<Callout type="warning">
  Never argue with a questioner. If someone seems hostile or determined to derail, stay calm, give a brief answer, and move on: "I appreciate your perspective. Let's talk more after the meeting."
</Callout>

### Timing Q&A

Watch the clock:
- Know when you need to move to the close
- "We have time for one or two more questions"
- "I want to respect everyone's time, so let me make a few closing remarks"

---

## The Close

This is where you call people to action. Don't be timid.

### Transition to the Close

Signal you're wrapping up:
- "As we close tonight, I want to leave you with something important."
- "Let me tell you why I believe this matters."

### The Emotional Connection

This is where a powerful video or story can make an impact:
- Baptism testimonial video
- Brief story of life change
- Vision of what this church could become

Don't manipulate, but do connect with people's hearts.

### The Ask

Be clear and direct:

*"We're looking for people who are ready to commit—people who are COMMITTED to the vision, COMPELLED by what God is doing, CONTAGIOUS in their enthusiasm, and COURAGEOUS enough to step out in faith. If that's you, I'm inviting you to join us."*

Tell them exactly what to do:
- "Fill out the response card and indicate your interest level"
- "Check the box that says you want to learn more about joining the Core Group"
- "I'll be following up with each of you personally this week"

### Next Steps

Make next steps crystal clear:
- "Our next Vision Meeting is [date]"
- "Core Group meets every other Sunday at [time]"
- "I'll be calling each of you within the next 48 hours"

---

## After the Formal Close

The meeting isn't over when you stop talking.

### Transition to Fellowship

- "Thank you for being here. Please stick around for dessert and conversation."
- Move toward the food/refreshment area
- Begin engaging guests personally

### Working the Room

For the next 30 minutes, you and your Core Group should be:
- Having one-on-one conversations
- Answering lingering questions
- Getting to know people personally
- Gathering response cards

### Watch for Signals

- Who's lingering? They may have more questions or higher interest.
- Who's heading for the door? Get to them before they leave.
- Who's talking to Core Group members? Those conversations may be significant.

<Callout type="tip">
  The person who stays latest often has the most questions—and the most interest. Don't rush them out. This may be your best opportunity for a meaningful conversation.
</Callout>

---

## Wrapping Up

### As Guests Leave

- Thank each person for coming
- Remind them of next steps
- Confirm you'll be following up
- Walk them out if possible

### After the Last Guest

- Collect all sign-in sheets and response cards
- Quick debrief with Core Group: What went well? What could improve?
- Pack up and leave the space better than you found it
- Pray together thanking God and committing the follow-up to Him

### Immediate Follow-Up Tasks

Before you go to bed:
- Review response cards
- Note anyone who seemed particularly interested (or concerned)
- Begin planning follow-up calls for tomorrow
