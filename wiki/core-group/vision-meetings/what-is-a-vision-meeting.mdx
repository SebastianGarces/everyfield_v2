The Vision Meeting is the main engine driving your entire launch process. It sits at the top of the funnel that transforms interested individuals into committed Core Group members who will help you plant a thriving church.

Understanding what a Vision Meeting is—and what it isn't—will shape how you approach this critical activity.

---

## The Heart of the Launch Process

A Vision Meeting is any gathering, large or small, formal or informal, where you and your key leaders cast a clear, compelling, and challenging vision to individuals considering joining the Core Group.

This definition is intentionally broad. Vision Meetings can take many forms:

- **Informal gatherings** — Coffee with 2-3 people interested in learning more
- **Small group settings** — Living room conversations with 8-10 potential members
- **Formal presentations** — Larger events targeting 30-50 attendees

The format matters less than the purpose: casting vision in such a way that transforms interested individuals into **COMMITTED, COMPELLED, CONTAGIOUS, and COURAGEOUS** Core Group members.

  Vision Meetings aren't about selling people on your church. They're about clearly articulating where God is leading and inviting the right people to join the journey.

## Seven Essential Elements

Every effective Vision Meeting includes these seven elements, regardless of size or format:

### 1. CONNECT

Connect authentically with the people attending. Create an atmosphere where genuine relationship can begin. People don't join visions—they join people with visions.

### 2. INFORM

Share the history, distinctives, values, and DNA of the church you're planting. Give people a clear picture of who you are and what you believe.

### 3. CAST VISION

Present the vision clearly, compellingly, and challengingly. Help people see what God is doing and what He wants to accomplish through this church plant.

### 4. ANSWER

Provide time for questions. People need their concerns addressed before they can commit. An unanswered question often becomes a reason not to join.

### 5. CALL FOR ACTION

Issue a genuine, non-manipulative call to commitment. Don't shy away from the ask—people need to be challenged to step forward.

### 6. CAPTURE

Gather contact information from everyone who attends. You cannot follow up with people you can't reach.

### 7. FOLLOW UP

Communicate clear next steps. What happens after tonight? When is the next meeting? What should they do if they want to learn more?

## What a Vision Meeting Is NOT

Understanding what to avoid is just as important as knowing what to include:

**Not a church service** — You're not trying to replicate Sunday morning. This is a recruitment and vision-casting event.

**Not a sales pitch** — You're not selling a product. You're inviting people into a calling.

**Not about you** — While your story matters, the focus should be on what God is doing and inviting them to be part of it.

**Not for everyone** — You're looking for specific kinds of people. Not everyone who attends will be the right fit, and that's okay.

---

## Frequency Matters

Schedule Vision Meetings at minimum every other week. Continue until the Lord brings a critical mass of **COMMITTED, COMPELLED, CONTAGIOUS, and COURAGEOUS** individuals—typically 50-100 adults.

<Callout type="important">
  Consistency is key. One great Vision Meeting won't build your Core Group. A steady rhythm of meetings over months will.
</Callout>

The frequency also allows different formats to serve different purposes:

- **Larger, formal meetings** — Cast the broad vision and reach new networks
- **Smaller, informal meetings** — Deepen relationships and answer detailed questions
- **One-on-one conversations** — Address specific concerns and personally challenge individuals to commit

---

## The Funnel in Action

Vision Meetings sit at the top of a funnel that moves people through a clear process:

| Stage | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **Network** | Friends, acquaintances, social connections—your sphere of influence |
| **Vision Meeting** | Cast vision, share distinctives, call for commitment |
| **Follow Up** | Answer questions, interview for fit, personally challenge |
| **Core Group** | Committed members who pray, give, and grow the group |

Every person who eventually joins your Core Group—and eventually your Launch Team—enters through this funnel. The Vision Meeting is your primary tool for moving people from "interested" to "committed."

---

## Why This Matters

Your Core Group will only be as strong as your Vision Meetings are effective. Weak Vision Meetings produce weak Core Groups. Strong Vision Meetings attract and develop the kind of people who can help you plant a thriving church.

This is why we dedicate so much attention to Vision Meetings in this playbook. Master this, and you'll have the foundation for everything that follows.
