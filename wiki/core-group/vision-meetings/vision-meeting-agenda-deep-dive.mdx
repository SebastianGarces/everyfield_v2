A Vision Meeting agenda looks simple on paper, but executing each element effectively requires understanding what you're trying to accomplish and how to do it well. This deep dive breaks down each component so you can lead with confidence.

## Before the Meeting Begins

### Setup (6:00 - 6:30)

What seems like "just setup" actually sets the stage for everything that follows. Arrive early enough that you're never rushed.

**Room arrangement:**
- Seating arranged to facilitate both presentation and conversation
- Clear sightlines to presentation screen
- Space for mingling before and after
- Sign-in table positioned near entrance

**AV check:**
- Projector/screen tested and focused
- Audio tested (can people hear clearly from all seats?)
- Presentation loaded and working
- Backup plan if technology fails

**Materials ready:**
- Sign-in sheets and pens
- Nametags (pre-printed or blank with markers)
- Handouts organized and accessible
- Response cards ready for distribution

<Callout type="tip">
  Always have a backup plan for technology failures. Know how you'd deliver your message if the projector died. A printout of key slides or the ability to speak without visuals keeps a tech failure from becoming a disaster.
</Callout>

## Meet and Greet (6:45 - 7:00)

This window isn't dead time before the "real" meeting starts. It's prime time for making first impressions and beginning relationships.

### What You're Accomplishing

- Welcoming people warmly as they arrive
- Capturing contact information before anyone slips away
- Beginning to build relationships through casual conversation
- Creating a warm, inviting atmosphere

### How to Execute

**At the door:**
- Greeter welcomes each person by name (if known) or introduces themselves
- Direct to sign-in table
- Offer nametag

**At the sign-in table:**
- Friendly face (not buried in paperwork)
- Quick, efficient process
- Capture name, email, phone at minimum
- Hand them any materials they need

**In the room:**
- Core Group members mingle with guests (not clustered together)
- Introduce guests to each other
- Casual conversation—don't start selling yet
- Offer refreshments if available

<Callout type="warning">
  Core Group members must resist the temptation to cluster together. Every Core Group member should be engaging with guests, not catching up with each other.
</Callout>

### Common Mistakes

- Making sign-in feel like an interrogation
- Allowing guests to sit alone without being engaged
- Starting late because you weren't ready
- Letting the room feel cold or unwelcoming

---

## Ice Breaker and Introduction (7:00 - 7:15)

The transition from casual mingling to the formal meeting requires intentionality. A good ice breaker breaks the tension and helps everyone feel included.

### Purpose of the Ice Breaker

- Transition attention from conversations to the group
- Help people feel comfortable speaking in the group
- Create shared experience and laughter
- Set a warm, non-intimidating tone

### Effective Ice Breaker Qualities

- **Quick** — 5-7 minutes maximum
- **Easy** — Everyone can participate without feeling put on the spot
- **Relevant** — Connects somehow to the purpose of the meeting
- **Fun** — Creates positive energy

### Sample Ice Breakers

**Two Truths and a Lie:**
Each person shares three statements about themselves—two true, one false. The group guesses which is the lie.

**Finish the Sentence:**
"I'm excited about the possibility of a new church because..." or "One thing I'm looking for in a church is..."

**Quick Connections:**
"Turn to someone you don't know and share one thing you love about this community/area."

<Callout type="insight">
  The best ice breakers feel natural, not forced. If you're uncomfortable with structured activities, try simply asking everyone to briefly introduce themselves with their name and one interesting fact.
</Callout>

### The Transition to Introduction

After the ice breaker, smoothly transition into introducing yourself and the purpose of the meeting:

- Thank everyone for coming
- Briefly introduce yourself (save the full story for the presentation)
- Preview what the next hour will look like
- Set expectations (Q&A time coming, response cards, etc.)

---

## The Presentation (7:15 - 7:45)

This is the heart of your Vision Meeting—where you cast the vision that will transform interested individuals into committed Core Group members.

### Structure Your Presentation

**1. Your Story (5-7 minutes)**

How God called you to plant this church. Include:
- Your spiritual journey and calling to ministry
- The specific moment or process when church planting became clear
- Why this location, this time, this community
- What you're leaving behind to pursue this calling

People follow people, not programs. Your story builds trust and demonstrates authenticity.

**2. The Church's Identity (10-12 minutes)**

What makes this church unique. Cover:
- Core values and convictions
- The 4 Pillars that guide your approach
- The Worship/Walk/Work model
- What visitors can expect on Sunday mornings
- What membership looks like

Use visuals effectively here—slides with key points, brief video clips, images that communicate culture.

**3. The Vision (8-10 minutes)**

What God wants to accomplish through this church. Paint a picture of:
- Lives transformed by the gospel
- Community impact you're believing God for
- The kind of church you're building
- Specific goals (launch date, launch team size, etc.)

This is where you cast compelling vision. Be specific enough to be believable, bold enough to require God to show up.

### Presentation Tips

| Do | Don't |
|-----|-------|
| Speak with passion and conviction | Read from notes or slides |
| Make eye contact | Stay glued to one spot |
| Tell stories that illustrate points | Bury people in information |
| Keep it concise | Ramble or repeat yourself |
| Use slides to support, not replace | Read slides word-for-word |
| Practice until confident | Wing it |

<Callout type="important">
  Your presentation should be well-rehearsed but not memorized. You want to communicate naturally, not robotically. Practice enough that you know the content cold, then let your personality come through in delivery.
</Callout>

## Question and Answer (7:45 - 8:15)

Q&A is not just a formality—it's a crucial opportunity to address concerns that could prevent people from committing.

### Setting Up Q&A

- Invite questions warmly: "What questions do you have?"
- If no one speaks first, have a Core Group member ready with a question
- Make it safe to ask anything: "There are no bad questions"

### Handling Different Types of Questions

**Legitimate information questions:**
Answer directly and thoroughly. These are easy.

**Skeptical questions:**
Don't get defensive. Acknowledge the concern, answer honestly, and move on. "That's a fair question. Here's how we think about that..."

**Tangent questions:**
Redirect graciously. "That's a great topic. Let's connect after and I can share more about that specifically."

**Challenging questions:**
Stay calm and humble. "I appreciate you asking that directly. Here's my honest answer..." If you don't know, say so.

### What If Nobody Has Questions?

- Be patient—sometimes people need a moment
- Have your planted question ready
- Ask a question of them: "What about what you heard tonight resonates with you?"
- Don't panic—it's not always a bad sign

<Callout type="tip">
  Keep track of questions you receive repeatedly. These are telling you what people care about most and may indicate areas where your presentation needs more clarity.
</Callout>

## The Strong Close (8:15 - 8:30)

This is where many Vision Meetings fail. You've built momentum—now you need to direct it toward action.

### Components of a Strong Close

**1. Summarize the Opportunity**

Briefly recap what you've shared and why it matters:
- What God is doing
- What you're building
- Why it matters
- Why now is the time

**2. Describe Who You're Looking For**

Be specific about the kind of people you need. Reference the 4 C's:

*"We're looking for people who are COMMITTED—willing to prioritize this above other good things. COMPELLED—driven by conviction, not convenience. CONTAGIOUS—whose enthusiasm will spread to others. And COURAGEOUS—willing to step out in faith."*

**3. Make the Ask**

Don't be vague. Tell people specifically what you want them to do:

- "We're asking you to prayerfully consider joining the Core Group."
- "Fill out the response card to indicate your level of interest."
- "Meet with me this week for a follow-up conversation."

**4. Outline Next Steps**

What happens after tonight?

- "Our next Vision Meeting is [date]. Mark it down."
- "I'll be following up personally with everyone this week."
- "Core Group meets every other Sunday at 4 PM."
- "Here's the calendar for the next two months."

### The Call Without Manipulation

<Callout type="warning">
  A strong close is direct, not manipulative. You're inviting, not pressuring. People should feel challenged, not trapped. If they're not ready, that's okay—but they need to be asked.
</Callout>

**Do:**
- Be clear about what you're asking
- Express genuine desire for them to join
- Create urgency without false pressure
- Make it easy to say yes

**Don't:**
- Use emotional manipulation
- Imply they're less spiritual if they don't join
- Rush people into premature commitment
- Ignore legitimate concerns or questions

---

## Fellowship and Dessert (8:30 - 9:00)

The meeting isn't over when the formal presentation ends. Some of your best relationship-building happens in this window.

### What You're Accomplishing

- Deepening connections begun earlier
- Having one-on-one conversations with interested individuals
- Answering questions people didn't want to ask publicly
- Allowing your Core Group to engage guests personally

### How to Maximize This Time

- Don't pack up immediately—stay present and engaged
- Move around the room, not staying in one conversation too long
- Core Group members should each target one guest for deeper conversation
- Watch for people leaving alone or seeming disconnected—engage them

<Callout type="insight">
  The guest who lingers after everyone else has left often has the most questions—and the most interest. Don't rush them out. This may be your best opportunity for a meaningful conversation.
</Callout>

## After the Last Person Leaves

Your work isn't done when guests leave.

### Immediate Tasks

- Collect all sign-in sheets and response cards
- Brief debrief with Core Group: What went well? What could improve?
- Note any specific follow-up needed (questions to answer, concerns raised)
- Pack up and leave the location better than you found it

### Within 48 Hours

- Enter all contact information into your database
- Assign follow-up calls to team members
- Send thank-you email to all attendees
- Begin personal follow-up with interested individuals
