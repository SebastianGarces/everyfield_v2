*/}

Your first Vision Meeting is a milestone. It marks the transition from dreaming about planting a church to actively recruiting your Core Group. The pressure can feel intense, but with proper preparation, your first meeting can set a strong foundation for everything that follows.

This guide walks you through the entire process from initial planning to follow-up.

## Setting Expectations

Before diving into logistics, set realistic expectations for your first meeting.

### What Success Looks Like

For a first Vision Meeting, success is:
- 10-15 attendees (not counting you and any existing team)
- Clear presentation of vision and distinctives
- Contact information captured from everyone
- 3-5 people expressing genuine interest in learning more
- A positive experience that generates word-of-mouth

### What Success Is NOT

Don't expect:
- Massive attendance (that comes later)
- Everyone committing on the spot
- Perfection in your presentation
- Zero hiccups with logistics

<Callout type="insight">
  Your first Vision Meeting is a first draft. You'll get better with practice. Focus on execution, learn from mistakes, and improve for the next one.

## Phase 1: Foundation (4-6 Weeks Out)

### Choose Your Date

Pick a date that:
- Gives you adequate preparation time (minimum 4 weeks)
- Avoids major holidays and competing events
- Works for the people you most want to attend
- Allows for evening timing (7:00 PM start is typical)

### Secure Your Location

For a first meeting, keep it simple:
- A living room works great for 10-20 people
- A church fellowship hall if you need more space
- A community center or library meeting room as backup

**Questions to answer:**
- Can it comfortably hold your target attendance?
- Is it easy to find with good parking?
- Can you control the environment (temperature, noise)?
- What's the cost?

### Identify Your First Invitees

Make a list of everyone you'll personally invite:
- Close friends who might be interested
- Family members in the area
- Former church connections
- Colleagues who share your faith
- Acquaintances you've been wanting to engage

Aim for a list of 30+ names—you'll need this many to get 10-15 attendees.

---

## Phase 2: Preparation (2-4 Weeks Out)

### Build Your Presentation

Your presentation should cover:

1. **Your story** (5-7 minutes)
   - How God called you to ministry
   - Why church planting specifically
   - Why this community, this time

2. **The church identity** (10 minutes)
   - Core values and beliefs
   - The 4 Pillars
   - The Worship/Walk/Work model
   - What Sundays will look like

3. **The vision** (8 minutes)
   - What God wants to accomplish
   - Lives changed, community impacted
   - Specific goals (launch date, launch team size)
   - Why this matters

4. **The invitation** (5 minutes)
   - Who you're looking for
   - What commitment looks like
   - Next steps

**Total: 28-30 minutes**

<Callout type="tip">
  Practice your presentation at least 5 times before the meeting. Record yourself if possible. Time each section so you know exactly where you are during delivery.
</Callout>

### Prepare Your Materials

For your first meeting, you need at minimum:
- Sign-in sheets
- Name tags and markers
- Printed handout with church overview
- Response cards
- Pens

Nice to have:
- Welcome brochure
- Banner or visual display
- Business cards

### Create Your Agenda

| Time | Activity | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| 6:30 | You arrive, setup | Everything ready before guests |
| 6:45 | Doors open | Greeting, sign-in begins |
| 7:00 | Welcome, ice breaker | 15 minutes |
| 7:15 | Presentation | 30 minutes |
| 7:45 | Q&A | 20 minutes |
| 8:05 | Close and next steps | 10 minutes |
| 8:15 | Fellowship/dessert | 30+ minutes |

### Begin Inviting

Start your invitation push:
- Personal conversations with your top prospects
- Phone calls to people you know
- Text messages with key details
- Social media announcement
- Email to your broader network

Remember: **Personal invitation is most effective.** Don't rely on mass communication alone.

## Phase 3: Final Week

### Confirm Attendance

Reach out to everyone who's shown interest:
- "Looking forward to seeing you Thursday!"
- "Can I count on you being there?"
- "Do you need directions or have any questions?"

### Finalize Logistics

- [ ] Location confirmed and accessible
- [ ] Room setup plan clear
- [ ] AV equipment tested
- [ ] Materials printed and organized
- [ ] Refreshments planned
- [ ] Transportation arranged for equipment

### Recruit Help

Even for your first meeting, you need some help:
- Someone to greet and handle sign-in
- Someone to manage refreshments
- Someone to help with setup/teardown

These might be your spouse, a close friend, or an early committed person. Don't try to do everything yourself.

### Prepare Spiritually

This is a spiritual work. Prepare accordingly:
- Dedicated prayer for the meeting and attendees
- Fasting if you're led to
- Asking others to pray for you
- Resting adequately the night before

---

## Phase 4: Meeting Day

### Before Guests Arrive

**2 hours before:**
- Arrive at location
- Begin room setup
- Test all technology

**1 hour before:**
- Materials laid out
- Refreshments ready
- Quick walk-through of the room
- Final tech test

**30 minutes before:**
- Brief your helpers
- Pray together
- Final mental preparation
- Ready to greet

<Callout type="important">
  You should be completely ready and relaxed when the first guest walks in. If you're still setting up, you've started behind.
</Callout>

### During the Meeting

**Greeting phase:**
- Be at the door to welcome people
- Make introductions
- Ensure everyone signs in

**Presentation phase:**
- Stick to your agenda
- Watch the clock
- Be yourself—authentic beats polished

**Q&A phase:**
- Encourage questions

**Close:**
- Be clear about what you're asking
- Make next steps explicit
- Express genuine hope they'll join

**Fellowship:**
- Work the room
- Have meaningful conversations
- Don't retreat to familiar people

### After the Last Guest Leaves

Before you leave:
- Collect all sign-in sheets and response cards
- Quick debrief: What went well? What was challenging?
- Clean up and return room to original condition
- Thank your helpers

---

## Phase 5: Follow-Up (24-72 Hours)

### Day 1: Immediate Follow-Up

**Send thank-you email to everyone:**

> Subject: Great meeting you last night!
>
> Thank you for coming to our Vision Meeting last night. It was great to share our vision with you, and I enjoyed getting to know you.
>
> If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'll be calling you in the next day or two to follow up.
>
> Our next gathering is [date]. Hope to see you there!

**Enter all contacts into your database**

**Review response cards and categorize:**
- High interest (want to join or learn more)
- Moderate interest (curious, need more info)
- Low interest (not for them right now)
- Unclear (need conversation to clarify)

### Days 2-3: Personal Follow-Up Calls

Call everyone who attended. For your first meeting, you should make these calls yourself.

**Call structure:**
1. Thank them for coming
2. Ask what they thought
3. Answer any questions
4. Gauge their interest level
5. Invite to next gathering or schedule one-on-one

**For high-interest people:**
Schedule a one-on-one coffee or meeting to go deeper and personally invite them to commit.

**For moderate-interest people:**
Answer questions, invite to the next Vision Meeting, note any concerns to address.

**For low-interest people:**
Thank them graciously, leave the door open, ask if they know anyone else who might be interested.

<Callout type="tip">
  Keep detailed notes from every follow-up call. What were their questions? What concerns did they express? What's their story? This information is gold for future conversations.
</Callout>

## After Your First Meeting: Evaluate

### What Worked?

Note what went well so you can repeat it:
- Which parts of your presentation landed?
- What questions came up?
- How did people respond to the close?
- What did your helpers observe?

### What Could Improve?

Be honest about areas for growth:
- Was anything confusing?
- Did anything run too long or too short?
- Were there logistics issues?
- What feedback did you receive?

### Adjust for Meeting #2

Based on your evaluation:
- Refine your presentation
- Adjust your timing
- Improve your materials
- Set a date for the next meeting (within 2 weeks)

## First Meeting FAQ

### How many people should I expect?

For a first meeting, 10-15 attendees is a healthy target. If you're personally inviting 30+ people, expect about 30-40% to actually show up.

### What if hardly anyone comes?

Don't be discouraged. Evaluate what happened:
- Were invitations personal enough?
- Was the timing bad?
- Did something else compete for attention?

Adjust and try again. Many successful churches had rocky first meetings.

### What if I freeze during the presentation?

It happens. Take a breath, glance at your notes, and keep going. No one expects perfection. Authenticity matters more than polish.

### How do I handle awkward silence during Q&A?

Wait longer than feels comfortable. Have a Core Group member ready with a seed question. You can also prompt: "What resonated with you? What made you curious?"

### What if someone is clearly not a good fit?

Be gracious. Thank them for coming. Some people will self-select out, and that's okay. You're not trying to recruit everyone.

  *"Do not despise these small beginnings, for the Lord rejoices to see the work begin."* — Zechariah 4:10 (NLT)
</Callout>

Your first Vision Meeting is a beginning, not a destination. Trust God with the outcome, learn from the experience, and keep building. Every great church started with a small group of people who caught a vision and said yes.
