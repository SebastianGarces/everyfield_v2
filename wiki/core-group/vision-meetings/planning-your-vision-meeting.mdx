Effective Vision Meetings don't happen by accident. They require thoughtful planning, careful preparation, and attention to detail. The good news is that with a solid planning process, you can consistently deliver meetings that move people from interested to committed.

This guide walks you through planning a Vision Meeting from start to finish.

## Start with the End in Mind

Before diving into logistics, clarify what you want to accomplish with this specific meeting.

**Questions to answer:**

- What type of meeting is this? (Formal presentation, informal gathering, one-on-one)
- Who is the target audience? (First-timers, people who've attended before, specific network)
- What action do you want people to take afterward?
- How does this meeting fit into your overall rhythm of Vision Meetings?

<Callout type="insight">
  Not every Vision Meeting needs to be a large, formal event. A series of smaller, informal gatherings can be just as effective—sometimes more so—for building genuine relationships and commitment.

## Choosing Your Format

Different situations call for different formats. Here's guidance on when to use each:

### Large Formal Meeting (25+ people)

**Best for:**
- Reaching new networks beyond your immediate sphere
- Creating momentum and energy
- Launching a new season of Vision Meetings

**Considerations:**
- Requires more planning and resources
- Less personal interaction with each guest
- Higher stakes if things go wrong

### Small Group Setting (8-15 people)

**Best for:**
- Deeper conversations and Q&A
- Building relationships with potential Core Group members
- Following up with people who've attended a larger meeting

**Considerations:**
- More intimate atmosphere
- Easier to manage logistics
- Allows everyone to participate in discussion

### Informal Gathering (2-5 people)

**Best for:**
- Personal invitation from Core Group members
- Answering specific questions
- Gauging interest before inviting to larger meeting

**Considerations:**
- Feels more like a conversation than a presentation
- Can be done at coffee shops, homes, or restaurants
- Lower commitment for potential attendees

<Callout type="tip">
  Mix your formats. Use large meetings to cast broad vision and reach new people. Use small gatherings to deepen relationships and answer questions. Use informal conversations to personally challenge people to commit.

## Location Selection

The right location removes barriers and sets the tone. The wrong location creates unnecessary obstacles.

### Evaluation Criteria

| Factor | Questions to Ask |
|--------|------------------|
| **Accessibility** | Is it easy to find? Adequate parking? ADA accessible? |
| **Atmosphere** | Does it feel welcoming? Clean? Appropriate for your brand? |
| **Size** | Right capacity for expected attendance? Not too big or small? |
| **Acoustics** | Can people hear clearly? Background noise manageable? |
| **Cost** | Within budget? What's included vs. extra? |
| **Availability** | Can you get it consistently? Backup options? |

### Common Location Types

**Homes**
- Pros: Intimate, personal, low cost
- Cons: Limited capacity, dependent on host availability

**Church facilities**
- Pros: Appropriate atmosphere, often affordable, good equipment
- Cons: May feel formal, requires relationship with host church

**Community centers**
- Pros: Neutral location, good capacity, professional setting
- Cons: Can feel sterile, may have restrictions

**Restaurants (private rooms)**
- Pros: Convenient, food handled for you
- Cons: Can be noisy, limited control, cost per person

## Building Your Agenda

A well-structured agenda keeps your meeting on track and ensures you accomplish your objectives.

### Standard Agenda Template

| Time | Activity | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| 6:00 - 6:30 | Setup | Room ready, AV tested, team briefed |
| 6:45 - 7:00 | Meet and Greet | Sign in, nametags, gather contact info |
| 7:00 - 7:15 | Ice Breaker / Introduction | Connect people, set the tone |
| 7:15 - 7:45 | Presentation | Cast vision, share distinctives |
| 7:45 - 8:15 | Q&A | Address questions, clarify concerns |
| 8:15 - 8:30 | Strong Close | Call to action, next steps |
| 8:30 - 9:00 | Fellowship | Dessert, conversation, relationship building |

<Callout type="warning">
  Respect people's time. Start on time, end on time. If you say the meeting ends at 9:00, end at 9:00. People who stay longer choose to stay; don't hold anyone hostage.
</Callout>

### Adjusting for Format

**For smaller gatherings:**
- Shorten formal presentation
- Increase time for discussion and Q&A
- Make it more conversational

**For larger meetings:**
- Build in more time for logistics (sign-in, seating)
- Consider breakout discussions after presentation
- Plan for coffee/refreshment flow

## Preparing Your Message

Your presentation is the centerpiece of the Vision Meeting. It deserves careful preparation.

### Content to Include

1. **Your story** — How God called you to plant this church
2. **The church's distinctives** — What makes this church unique
3. **The vision** — What God wants to accomplish through this church
4. **The invitation** — How people can be part of it

### Presentation Tips

- **Practice out loud** — Reading it and saying it are different skills
- **Time yourself** — Know exactly how long each section takes
- **Use visuals wisely** — PowerPoint supports your message, doesn't replace it
- **Tell stories** — People remember stories more than bullet points
- **Be yourself** — Authenticity matters more than polish

## The Invitation Strategy

Great meetings with empty chairs accomplish nothing. You need a strategy for getting people there.

### Core Group Responsibility

Every Core Group member should understand that bringing people to Vision Meetings is a primary responsibility—not an optional extra.

**Set clear expectations:**
- Each member commits to inviting at least 5 people per meeting
- Goal: Each member brings at least one person or couple to every meeting
- Track and celebrate successes

### Invitation Methods

- Personal invitation (most effective)
- Phone calls to personal contacts
- Text messages with meeting details
- Social media posts and shares
- Email to personal networks
- Printed invitation cards to hand out

<Callout type="important">
  Personal invitation is always the most effective method. A text blast might reach more people, but a personal conversation is far more likely to result in attendance.
</Callout>

## After the Meeting

Planning doesn't end when the meeting does. Post-meeting activities are crucial for converting attendance into commitment.

### Immediate (within 48 hours)

- [ ] Send thank-you email to all attendees
- [ ] Enter all contact information into database
- [ ] Assign follow-up responsibilities
- [ ] Debrief with Core Group (what worked, what didn't)

### Within One Week

- [ ] Personal follow-up calls with all first-time attendees
- [ ] Schedule one-on-one conversations with interested individuals
- [ ] Update attendance tracking
- [ ] Begin planning next Vision Meeting
