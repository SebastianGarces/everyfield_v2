The most prepared Vision Meeting accomplishes nothing with empty chairs. Your ability to consistently fill those chairs with the right people will determine how quickly your Core Group grows.

This guide covers proven strategies for inviting people effectively.

## The Cardinal Principle

Before diving into tactics, understand the foundational principle that makes everything else work:

**The Core Group needs to own the responsibility with the Senior Pastor in building the Core Group numerically. Building the Core Group is job number one for every Core Group member.**

This isn't optional. If only the Senior Pastor is inviting people, growth will plateau. When every Core Group member actively invites, growth compounds.

<Callout type="important">
  Every member of the Core Group must feel the weight of this responsibility. They're not just attending—they're building. If they're not inviting, they're not fully engaged.
</Callout>

## The Ask, Seek, Knock Approach

This biblical framework provides the foundation for your invitation strategy.

### Ask the Lord of Harvest

Before you ask anyone to attend, ask God to raise up workers for the harvest.

- Pray specifically for names and faces to come to mind
- Ask God to prepare hearts before you approach them
- Seek wisdom about timing and approach
- Trust that God is already at work drawing people

### Seek Them Out

Actively look for potential Core Group members in your sphere of influence:

- **Friends** — People you already have relationship with
- **Acquaintances** — People you know but haven't gone deep with
- **Connections of connections** — Friends of friends who might be interested
- **New relationships** — Intentionally build relationships with potential members

### Knock and Invite

Once you've identified potential members, extend a clear invitation:

- Be direct about what you're inviting them to
- Explain why you think they'd be a good fit
- Make it easy for them to say yes (or no)
- Follow up if they express interest

## Invitation Methods Ranked by Effectiveness

Not all invitations are created equal. Here's how different methods stack up:

| Method | Effectiveness | Best For |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| **Personal conversation** | Highest | People you know well |
| **Phone call** | High | Personal contacts, follow-up |
| **Personal text/message** | Medium-High | Initial outreach, reminders |
| **Personalized email** | Medium | Detailed information, scheduling |
| **Social media post** | Low-Medium | Broad awareness, new networks |
| **Mass email blast** | Low | Announcements, not recruitment |

<Callout type="insight">
  The more personal the invitation, the more likely someone is to attend. A face-to-face conversation is worth more than 100 social media posts.
</Callout>

## Having the Conversation

When you identify someone to invite, here's how to approach the conversation:

### The Framework

1. **Share your excitement** — Let your enthusiasm show
2. **Explain the opportunity** — What the church plant is and why it matters
3. **Make the connection** — Why you thought of them specifically
4. **Extend the invitation** — Clearly ask them to attend
5. **Handle objections** — Address concerns graciously
6. **Confirm next steps** — Get a commitment or clear follow-up

### Sample Scripts

**For someone you know well:**

*"Hey, I wanted to tell you about something I'm really excited about. I'm part of planting a new church, and we're looking for people who want to be part of building something from the ground up. Honestly, you were one of the first people I thought of. Would you come to our next Vision Meeting on [date] to hear more about it?"*

**For an acquaintance:**

*"I've been meaning to reach out to you. I'm involved in starting a new church in [area], and we're gathering people who are passionate about making a difference. I don't know if this is on your radar at all, but would you be open to coming to hear more about what we're doing?"*

**For someone referred to you:**

*"[Mutual friend] mentioned that you might be interested in what we're building. We're planting a new church and looking for people who want to be part of the Core Group. Could I tell you more about it over coffee, or would you want to come to our next gathering?"*

## Setting Invitation Goals

Vague commitments produce vague results. Set specific goals for your Core Group:

### Individual Goals

Each Core Group member should commit to:

- Invite at least **5 people** to every Vision Meeting
- Bring at least **one person or couple** to every meeting
- Have at least **3 invitation conversations** per week

### Group Goals

Track and celebrate as a group:

- Total number of invitations extended
- Total number of first-time attendees
- Conversion rate from invitation to attendance

<Callout type="tip">
  What gets measured gets managed. Track invitation activity and celebrate wins. When someone brings a guest who joins the Core Group, make it a big deal.
</Callout>

## Leveraging Your Network

### Direct Network

People you already know personally:

- Friends from work, neighborhood, gym, etc.
- Family members (even distant relatives)
- Former church members or ministry connections
- College friends, old roommates, colleagues

### Indirect Network

People your network knows:

- Ask Core Group members: "Who do you know who might be interested?"
- Ask friends: "Who in your circle is looking for a church?"
- Ask family: "Do you know anyone in [area] who loves Jesus?"

### Expanding Your Network

Intentionally build new relationships:

- Join community groups, clubs, or activities
- Attend local events and get involved
- Volunteer in community organizations
- Build relationships with neighbors you don't know yet

---

## Using Invitation Cards

Physical invitation cards are a powerful tool for several reasons:

- **Tangible reminder** — Harder to forget than a verbal invitation
- **Easy to share** — The invitee can pass it to someone else
- **Professional appearance** — Communicates this is legitimate
- **All the details** — Date, time, location, contact info in one place

### What to Include

- Church name and logo
- "You're Invited to a Vision Meeting"
- Date, time, location
- Brief description (1-2 sentences)
- Your website or QR code
- Contact information

### Distribution Strategy

- Give 5-10 cards to every Core Group member
- Encourage them to always have cards available
- Train them to hand cards out during conversations
- Replenish regularly

---

## Social Media Strategy

Social media can extend your reach beyond your immediate network.

### Effective Approaches

**Personal posts:**
Share your excitement about what you're building. Be authentic, not salesy.

*"I'm so excited about this new church we're planting. If you're in [area] and curious about being part of something new, message me."*

**Event invitations:**
Create Facebook events for Vision Meetings. Invite friends and ask Core Group members to do the same.

**Share stories:**
Post photos and updates from Vision Meetings (with permission). Let people see the energy and community.

### What to Avoid

- Don't spam people with repeated invitations
- Don't make promises you can't keep
- Don't criticize other churches
- Don't be pushy or manipulative

<Callout type="warning">
  Social media reaches many people but converts few. Use it to create awareness and open doors, but don't rely on it for your primary invitation strategy.
</Callout>

## Training Your Core Group

Don't assume Core Group members know how to invite effectively. Train them:

### Regular Training Topics

- How to share your personal story and excitement
- How to handle common objections
- How to identify potential Core Group members
- How to follow up after an invitation

### Role Playing

Practice invitation conversations:
- One person plays the inviter, another plays the potential guest
- Work through different scenarios and objections
- Give feedback and coaching
- Build confidence through repetition

### Accountability

Create a rhythm of accountability:
- Weekly check-in: "How many invitation conversations did you have?"
- Monthly review: "Who did you bring this month?"
- Quarterly celebration: "Look how God has grown our group!"

---

## Handling "No" Gracefully

Not everyone will say yes. Handle rejection well:

### In the Moment

- Thank them for considering it
- Don't argue or pressure
- Leave the door open: "If anything changes, let me know"
- Maintain the relationship

### After a "No"

- Don't take it personally
- Don't give up on the relationship
- Circle back in a few months if appropriate
- Ask if they know anyone else who might be interested

<Callout type="insight">
  A "no" today might be a "yes" later. Life circumstances change. Keep the relationship warm, and you may find the door opens in the future.
</Callout>
