It is critical to have database management software to accurately and effectively follow up with leads. Without a system, contacts get lost, follow up becomes inconsistent, and potential Core Group members slip through the cracks.

This guide helps you choose and implement a contact management system that supports your follow up efforts from day one.

## Why Database Management Matters

Every Vision Meeting generates contacts. Every contact represents a potential Core Group member. But potential only converts to reality through systematic follow up—and systematic follow up requires organized data.

<Callout type="important">
  The church planter who tracks every contact and follows up consistently will build a larger Core Group than the one who relies on memory and good intentions.
</Callout>

### What Happens Without a System

- Names and contact information get lost
- Follow up happens inconsistently or not at all
- Multiple people may contact the same person (or no one does)
- You lose track of where people are in the process
- Interest fades before you reconnect

### What a Good System Enables

- Capture every contact completely
- Assign clear follow-up responsibility
- Track every interaction
- Move people through stages (interested → interviewed → committed)
- Generate reminders for timely follow up
- Report on progress and identify gaps

## Choosing Your System

Your database doesn't need to be complex or expensive. What matters is that you use it consistently. Here are options ranging from simple to sophisticated.

### Option 1: Spreadsheet

**Best for:** Very early stages, small number of contacts, limited budget

A well-designed spreadsheet can serve your needs initially. Use Google Sheets or Excel to track:

| Column | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Name | Full name |
| Email | Email address |
| Phone | Phone number |
| Date Met | When they attended Vision Meeting |
| Status | Interested / Following Up / Interviewing / Committed / Declined |
| Assigned To | Who is responsible for follow up |
| Last Contact | Date of most recent interaction |
| Next Step | What needs to happen next |
| Notes | Context from conversations |

**Pros:**
- Free or very low cost
- Familiar interface
- Easy to share with co-leaders
- Can sort and filter as needed

**Cons:**
- Manual data entry and updates
- Limited automation
- Doesn't scale well past 50-100 contacts
- No built-in reminders

<Callout type="tip">
  If using a spreadsheet, review it weekly and update the "Last Contact" and "Next Step" columns for every active contact. This simple discipline prevents people from being forgotten.
</Callout>

### Option 2: Contact Management Software

**Best for:** Growing contact lists, need for automation, multiple people doing follow up

Dedicated contact management software provides more structure and automation than spreadsheets.

**Features to Look For:**

- Contact records with customizable fields
- Status/stage tracking
- Task and reminder system
- Activity logging
- Email integration
- Reporting and search

**Options to Consider:**

| Software | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| **HubSpot CRM** | Free tier available, robust features, good for growing teams |
| **Airtable** | Flexible database, combines spreadsheet ease with database power |
| **Notion** | Customizable, good for teams already using it |
| **Monday.com** | Project-focused but adaptable for contact management |

**Church-Specific Options:**

Some church management software includes CRM features that work well for the Core Group stage:

- **Planning Center People** — Widely used, integrates with other church tools
- **Breeze** — Simple and affordable
- **Church Community Builder** — More robust, better for larger operations

---

### Option 3: Full CRM System

**Best for:** Larger operations, need for advanced automation, multiple ministry areas to coordinate

Full CRM (Customer Relationship Management) systems offer the most functionality but also the most complexity.

**Examples:**

- **Salesforce Nonprofit Cloud** — Powerful but steep learning curve
- **Pipedrive** — Sales-focused but adaptable
- **Zoho CRM** — Affordable with good features

<Callout type="warning">
  Avoid over-engineering your system. Start simple and upgrade as needed. A complex system you don't use is worse than a simple one you use consistently.
</Callout>

## Setting Up Your System

Regardless of which tool you choose, set up these core elements:

### 1. Contact Record Fields

At minimum, capture:

- **Full name**
- **Email address**
- **Phone number**
- **How they heard about you** (referral, social media, etc.)
- **Date of first contact** (which Vision Meeting they attended)
- **Spouse/family information** (if applicable)

### 2. Status Stages

Create clear stages that reflect your process:

| Stage | Definition |
|-------|------------|
| **New** | Just captured, no follow up yet |
| **Contacted** | Initial follow up made |
| **Interested** | Engaged, continuing conversation |
| **Interviewing** | In formal assessment process |
| **Committed** | Joined Core Group |
| **Not Now** | Interested but not ready—follow up later |
| **Declined** | Not joining—no further follow up |

### 3. Activity Logging

Record every interaction:

- Phone calls (date, summary, outcome)
- Emails sent and received
- In-person meetings
- Texts and messages
- Attendance at events

### 4. Follow-Up Reminders

Build in prompts for follow up:

- Automatic reminder if no contact in X days
- Tasks assigned with due dates
- Calendar integration for scheduled calls/meetings

## Managing Your Database

A database only works if you maintain it. Establish these habits:

### Daily Habits

- Log every interaction immediately (don't wait until later)
- Update status when it changes
- Check for follow-up tasks due today

### Weekly Habits

- Review all contacts in "New" or "Contacted" status
- Identify anyone who hasn't been contacted in 7+ days
- Assign follow-up tasks for the coming week
- Update notes based on recent conversations

### After Each Vision Meeting

- Enter all new contacts within 24 hours
- Assign follow-up responsibility for each
- Set initial follow-up tasks with 48-hour deadlines

<Callout type="insight">
  The week after a Vision Meeting is the most critical time for database discipline. Every new contact should have an owner and a next step before you go to bed that night.
</Callout>

## Sharing Responsibility

As your Core Group grows, you can share follow-up responsibility with trusted leaders. Your database makes this possible by:

- Assigning specific contacts to specific people
- Tracking who is doing follow up
- Providing visibility into overall progress
- Preventing duplicate efforts or gaps

### Guidelines for Shared Follow Up

- The Senior Pastor should personally follow up with the most promising contacts
- Match follow-up responsibility based on relationship and chemistry
- Ensure the Senior Pastor has visibility into all activity
- Meet weekly to review progress and reassign as needed

---

## Data Privacy and Stewardship

Handle contact data with care:

- Only collect information you need and will use
- Store data securely (password protection, limited access)
- Be clear about how you'll use their information
- Honor opt-out requests promptly
- Don't share contact information outside your team

Managing your contacts well is an act of stewardship. Every name in your database represents someone God may be drawing into your Core Group. A faithful system ensures you treat each person with the attention and follow-through they deserve.
