Effective follow-up requires a system. Without database management software to accurately track leads and follow-up activities, people fall through the cracks, opportunities are missed, and the Core Group grows more slowly than it should.

This guide covers how to set up and use a database system that supports your follow-up efforts.

## Why Database Management Matters

### The Problem Without a System

When you're dealing with dozens of Vision Meeting contacts, memory alone isn't enough:

- You forget who you've contacted and what was discussed
- People who expressed interest never hear from you again
- There's no record of questions asked or concerns raised
- Core Group members don't know who's been contacted
- You can't measure or improve your follow-up effectiveness

### What a Good System Provides

- **Centralized contacts** — Everyone in one place
- **Follow-up tracking** — Record of every touchpoint
- **Status visibility** — Know where each person is in the funnel
- **Assignment clarity** — Who's responsible for following up with whom
- **Historical record** — What was discussed, what concerns were raised
- **Reporting** — Metrics to measure effectiveness

<Callout type="insight">
  A database isn't bureaucracy—it's stewardship. Every contact represents a person God may be drawing to your church. A good system helps you steward those relationships well.

## Choosing a System

You have several options, depending on your budget, technical capacity, and needs:

### Option 1: Spreadsheet

**Tools:** Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets

**Pros:**
- Free or very low cost
- Flexible and customizable
- No learning curve if you know spreadsheets
- Easy to share with Core Group

**Cons:**
- Manual entry and updating
- No automation or reminders
- Can become unwieldy as contacts grow
- Limited reporting capabilities

**Best for:** Early stages with fewer than 50 contacts, or if budget is very tight.

### Option 2: Contact Management Software

**Tools:** ACT!, Goldmine, HubSpot CRM (free tier)

**Pros:**
- Designed for relationship management
- Built-in reminders and task tracking
- Better reporting than spreadsheets
- Scales as you grow

**Cons:**
- Learning curve
- May have costs as you scale
- May be overkill for small operations

**Best for:** When you're ready to professionalize your process and have 50+ contacts to manage.

### Option 3: Church Management Software

**Tools:** Planning Center, FellowshipOne, Breeze, ChurchTrac

**Pros:**
- Designed specifically for churches
- Can grow with you post-launch
- Often includes giving, groups, and volunteer management
- Integrations with other church tools

**Cons:**
- Monthly subscription costs
- May have features you don't need yet
- Setup investment

**Best for:** If you want to invest in a long-term solution you'll use post-launch.

<Callout type="tip">
  Start simple and upgrade as needed. A well-maintained spreadsheet beats a sophisticated system that nobody uses. Choose what you'll actually maintain consistently.

## What to Track

Regardless of the system you use, track these essential fields:

### Contact Information

| Field | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| Name | First and last |
| Email | Primary communication |
| Phone | For calls and texts |
| Address | Optional but useful |
| Spouse name | If married |
| Children | Names and ages if relevant |

### Source and Status

| Field | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| How they heard about us | Which Vision Meeting, who invited them |
| First Vision Meeting attended | Date |
| Vision Meetings attended | Total count |
| Current status | Lead, Interested, In Process, Core Group, Declined |
| Assigned to | Who's responsible for follow-up |

### Follow-Up History

| Field | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| Date of each contact | When you reached out |
| Type of contact | Call, text, email, in-person |
| Summary | What was discussed |
| Next step | What happens next, when |
| Questions/concerns | Anything to address |

### Notes

Free-form notes capturing anything relevant:
- Their story and spiritual journey
- Family situation
- Work and life context
- Gifts and potential contributions
- Red flags or concerns

## Status Categories

Create clear status categories to track where people are:

| Status | Definition |
|--------|------------|
| **New Lead** | Attended Vision Meeting, not yet contacted |
| **Contacted** | Initial follow-up made |
| **In Conversation** | Ongoing dialogue, not yet committed |
| **Scheduled Interview** | Interview meeting scheduled |
| **Pending Decision** | Interviewed, awaiting their decision |
| **Core Group** | Committed and signed |
| **Not Right Now** | Declined or not a fit currently |
| **Closed** | Definitively not interested |

---

## Using the System Effectively

### Daily Habits

- Enter new contacts immediately after Vision Meetings
- Log every follow-up conversation the same day
- Check for overdue follow-ups

### Weekly Review

- Review all contacts in "New Lead" status—why haven't they been contacted?
- Review "In Conversation" contacts—what's the next step?
- Identify anyone who's gone cold and needs re-engagement
- Update statuses based on recent activity

### After Each Vision Meeting

- Enter all sign-in sheet information into database
- Note who invited each person
- Assign follow-up responsibility
- Set follow-up deadlines (48 hours)

<Callout type="important">
  A database is only as good as its data. Commit to entering information consistently and keeping it current. Outdated data is worse than no data—it creates false confidence.
</Callout>

## Sharing with Your Team

As the Core Group grows, you'll share follow-up responsibility. Make sure your system supports this:

### Access Control

- Decide who needs access to what
- Some systems allow role-based permissions
- Be thoughtful about sensitive information

### Assignment Clarity

- Each contact should have a clear "owner"
- Owners are responsible for follow-up and updates
- Regular review ensures assignments are working

### Reporting

- Create simple reports to share progress:
  - Total leads in process
  - New contacts this month
  - Conversions to Core Group
  - Contacts by status

## Sample Spreadsheet Setup

If using a spreadsheet, here's a suggested structure:

### Contacts Tab

| Name | Email | Phone | Invited By | First Attended | Status | Assigned To |
|------|-------|-------|------------|----------------|--------|-------------|
| John Smith | john@email.com | 555-1234 | Mary Jones | 2025-01-15 | In Conversation | Pastor |
| Jane Doe | jane@email.com | 555-5678 | Direct invite | 2025-01-15 | New Lead | Tom |

### Follow-Up Log Tab

| Contact Name | Date | Type | Summary | Next Step |
|--------------|------|------|---------|-----------|
| John Smith | 2025-01-17 | Phone | Discussed questions about time commitment | Coffee meeting scheduled for 1/22 |
| John Smith | 2025-01-22 | In-Person | Great conversation, ready to commit | Send commitment card |

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall: Data Entry Falls Behind

**Problem:** You stop entering information consistently.

**Solution:** Make it part of your rhythm—after every Vision Meeting, after every call. Don't let it pile up.

### Pitfall: No One Owns the System

**Problem:** Multiple people updating inconsistently or not at all.

**Solution:** Assign a database owner responsible for data quality, even if others enter information.

### Pitfall: System Too Complex

**Problem:** You set up elaborate tracking that no one maintains.

**Solution:** Start simple. Track only what you'll actually use. Expand as you build the habit.

### Pitfall: Data Never Used

**Problem:** You collect data but never review or act on it.

**Solution:** Build regular review into your weekly rhythm. Data is only valuable if it drives action.
