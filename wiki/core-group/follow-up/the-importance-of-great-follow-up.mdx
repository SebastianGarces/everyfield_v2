The importance of timely, effective follow up to those who attend a Vision Meeting cannot be overstated. Do this well and your Core Group grows dramatically. Do it poorly and you waste time planning Vision Meetings.

Every Vision Meeting generates interest. People leave thinking about what they heard, processing the vision, and weighing whether this is something they want to be part of. What happens in the days immediately following determines whether that interest becomes commitment—or fades away.

## Why Follow Up Makes or Breaks Your Launch

Vision Meetings are the engine that drives your Core Group development. But the engine only produces results when follow up converts interest into action. Consider this sobering reality:

  A well-executed Vision Meeting with poor follow up produces fewer Core Group members than an average Vision Meeting with excellent follow up.
</Callout>

The investment you make in planning, preparing, and presenting at Vision Meetings is wasted if you don't close the loop with intentional follow up.

### The Follow Up Window

There's a critical window after each Vision Meeting when interest is highest and decisions are most likely. This window begins to close within 24-48 hours. Every day that passes without contact decreases the likelihood of commitment.

| Timeframe | Interest Level | Action Required |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| 0-24 hours | Peak interest | Initial contact—thank you, next steps |
| 24-48 hours | Strong interest | Personal conversation, answer questions |
| 3-7 days | Declining interest | Schedule follow-up meeting or coffee |
| 7+ days | Significant drop | May require re-engagement or new Vision Meeting |

## The Four Purposes of Follow Up

Great follow up accomplishes four distinct purposes. Each is essential to moving people from interest to commitment.

### 1. Answer Questions

Many people leave Vision Meetings with unanswered questions—things they didn't think to ask, questions they were too hesitant to raise publicly, or new questions that emerged after reflection. Follow up gives them the opportunity to get the clarity they need to make an informed decision.

### 2. Re-Cast the Vision

People rarely grasp a vision fully the first time they hear it. Follow up provides another opportunity to cast the vision, reinforce key points, and help them see what God is doing. Great leaders continually cast vision of future days, events, and fruitfulness.

### 3. Interview for Fit

Not everyone who attends a Vision Meeting is a good fit for the Core Group. Follow up allows you to assess whether someone has the qualities needed—maturity, chemistry, right reasons, and appropriate season of life.

### 4. Challenge to Commitment

Follow up is where you personally invite people to join the Core Group. This direct challenge is essential. Many people need to be asked clearly and personally before they'll take the step.

## Who Owns Follow Up?

Follow up is primarily the responsibility of the Senior Pastor, but as the Core Group grows, this responsibility can and should be shared with key leaders.

<Callout type="tip">
  Track every Vision Meeting attendee in a simple database or spreadsheet. Assign follow-up responsibility and record every contact. Nothing should fall through the cracks.
</Callout>

### The 48-Hour Rule

Establish a non-negotiable standard: every Vision Meeting attendee receives personal contact within 48 hours. This might be:

- A phone call from the Senior Pastor
- A personal email with next steps
- A text message thanking them and offering to answer questions
- An invitation to coffee or a follow-up meeting

The method matters less than the timing and the personal touch.

## Common Follow Up Mistakes

### Waiting Too Long

The most common mistake is simply waiting too long. Life is busy. People's attention moves on. What felt urgent on Saturday night feels less pressing by Wednesday.

### Being Impersonal

Mass emails and generic follow up fail to capitalize on the personal connection made at the Vision Meeting. People responded to a person and a vision—follow up should reinforce that personal connection.

### Lacking Clear Next Steps

Every follow-up contact should include a clear next step. What do you want them to do? Come to the next Core Group meeting? Meet for coffee? Attend another Vision Meeting with their spouse? Don't leave them wondering.

### Giving Up Too Soon

Some people need multiple touches before they commit. Don't interpret delayed response as rejection. People are processing significant decisions. Stay in touch without being pushy.

## Building a Follow Up System

Effective follow up requires a system, not just good intentions. Your system should include:

1. **Capture** — Gather complete contact information at every Vision Meeting
2. **Track** — Record every person and their status in a database
3. **Assign** — Designate who is responsible for following up with each person
4. **Contact** — Reach out within 48 hours using the appropriate method
5. **Record** — Document every interaction and next steps
6. **Review** — Regularly review your list to ensure no one is forgotten

<Callout type="insight">
  The discipline of follow up separates church plants that grow from those that stall. It's not glamorous work, but it's essential work.

Follow up requires persistence and discipline. The reward is a Core Group of **COMMITTED, COMPELLED, CONTAGIOUS, and COURAGEOUS** members who are fully aligned with the vision. That outcome is worth every phone call, every coffee meeting, and every intentional conversation.
