Follow up after Vision Meetings isn't just helpful—it's vital. Without effective follow up, even the best Vision Meetings fail to produce the Core Group growth you need. Understanding the *why* behind follow up will help you prioritize it and execute it well.

The Launch Playbook identifies four specific reasons why great follow up is non-negotiable. Each serves a distinct purpose in moving people from interest to commitment.

## 1. Answer Questions

Many people leave Vision Meetings with unanswered questions. These questions are legitimate and need answers before someone can make an informed decision to join the Core Group.

### Why Questions Go Unasked

People don't ask every question at Vision Meetings for various reasons:

- **Public hesitation** — Some questions feel too personal or vulnerable to ask in a group setting
- **Delayed processing** — Questions often emerge *after* the meeting as people reflect on what they heard
- **Spouse discussions** — Couples processing together generate new questions
- **Practical concerns** — Logistics, time commitments, and expectations may need clarification

<Callout type="tip">
  When following up, always ask: "What questions do you have?" Don't assume silence means clarity. Create space for people to voice concerns.
</Callout>

### Common Questions That Arise

| Category | Typical Questions |
|----------|------------------|
| **Commitment** | How much time will this require? What exactly am I signing up for? |
| **Theological** | What do you believe about [specific issue]? How do you handle disagreements? |
| **Practical** | When and where will we meet? What about my kids? |
| **Financial** | What are the expectations around giving? How will funds be used? |
| **Relational** | Who else is involved? Will I know anyone? |

### The Goal: An Informed Core Group

We want people to join with eyes wide open. An informed Core Group member is more likely to be a committed Core Group member. Unanswered questions create uncertainty, and uncertainty leads to hesitation or—worse—early departure.

## 2. Re-Casting the Vision

A follow up meeting gives opportunity to re-cast the vision. This isn't repetition for its own sake—it's essential to how people process significant decisions.

### Why Vision Needs Repetition

**People rarely grasp a vision fully the first time they hear it.**

Consider how much information you shared in your Vision Meeting: your story, the church's distinctives, the mission, the values, the timeline, the commitment expected. That's a lot to absorb in one sitting.

<Callout type="insight">
  Research suggests people need to hear something 7-10 times before it truly sinks in. Follow up is your opportunity to reinforce what matters most.
</Callout>

### How to Re-Cast in Follow Up

Re-casting vision in follow up looks different than in a Vision Meeting. It's more personal and conversational:

1. **Share specific stories** — How God has been working, who has joined, what you're seeing
2. **Paint the future** — Help them see what the church will look like, the impact it will have
3. **Connect to their story** — Show how their gifts and passions fit the vision
4. **Address their specific interests** — If they mentioned children's ministry, talk about that vision specifically

### The Power of Personal Vision Casting

Great leaders continually cast vision of future days, events, and fruitfulness. When you cast vision one-on-one, you can:

- Tailor the message to what resonates with them specifically
- Allow them to ask clarifying questions
- Help them see their place in the story
- Build personal connection and trust

## 3. Interview for Fit

Not everyone who attends a Vision Meeting and expresses interest is a good fit for the Core Group. Best practices include careful interviewing before allowing someone to sign up.

This may feel uncomfortable, but it's essential for building a healthy Core Group.

### Why Interview?

The Core Group is the foundation of your church plant. These aren't just attenders—they're builders. They need to be **COMMITTED, COMPELLED, CONTAGIOUS, and COURAGEOUS**. Interviewing helps you assess whether someone has these qualities.

<Callout type="warning">
  Adding the wrong people to your Core Group can be more damaging than having a smaller group. One divisive or uncommitted member can undermine the entire team.
</Callout>

### The Five Interview Criteria

When evaluating fit, consider these five factors:

| Criterion | Key Question | What to Look For |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| **Maturity** | Are they spiritually and emotionally mature? | Evidence of growth, self-awareness, ability to handle conflict |
| **Gifted** | Do they bring a needed skill set? | Specific abilities, experience, or connections that benefit the plant |
| **Chemistry** | Is there good chemistry between you and them? | Natural rapport, shared values, ability to work together |
| **Right Reasons** | Are they coming for the right reasons? | Genuine calling, not escaping problems or seeking position |
| **Season of Life** | Are they in a stable season of life? | Margin and availability, not in crisis or major transition |

### Interview as Discernment

Interviewing isn't about finding perfect people—it's about discernment. You're asking: Is this person ready for this particular assignment at this particular time?

Someone might be a wonderful believer but not in the right season for church planting. That's okay. It's better to recognize this now than after they've joined and are struggling.

## 4. Challenge/Call to Core Group

The fourth purpose of follow up is perhaps the most important: personally challenging acceptable candidates to join the Core Group.

### The Power of Direct Invitation

Many people won't commit until they're directly asked. They may be interested. They may be leaning toward joining. But without a clear, personal challenge, they may never take the final step.

<Callout type="important">
  Don't assume people know they're welcome or wanted. Assume they need to hear it directly from you.
</Callout>

### How to Issue the Challenge

A good challenge is:

1. **Direct** — "We would love for you to join the Core Group."
2. **Personal** — "I see how your gifts in [area] could make a real difference."
3. **Specific** — "Our next step would be for you to come to the Core Group meeting on [date]."
4. **Patient** — "Take some time to pray about it. I'd love to talk again in a few days."

### Following Up on the Challenge

After you've issued the challenge, continue following up:

- If they said yes: Confirm their commitment, provide next steps, celebrate with them
- If they're uncertain: Give them time, answer any additional questions, follow up again
- If they declined: Thank them for considering it, leave the door open, stay in relationship

### Vital and Must Be Consistently Pursued

The Launch Playbook states that this personal challenge "is vital and must be consistently pursued." Don't make the mistake of assuming interest will naturally convert to commitment. It won't—not without intentional invitation.

## Putting It All Together

Every follow-up conversation should touch on all four purposes:

1. **Open with questions** — "What questions do you have after Saturday's meeting?"
2. **Re-cast the vision** — Share what excites you, paint the picture of what God is doing
3. **Discern fit** — Listen carefully, assess the five criteria, be honest
4. **Challenge to commitment** — If appropriate, issue a clear, direct invitation

Not every conversation will lead to all four, but keep these purposes in mind as you follow up with each person.

  *"Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you."* — Matthew 7:7
</Callout>

Follow up embodies the principle of asking, seeking, and knocking. You're asking the Lord to bring the right people. You're seeking them out through intentional follow up. You're knocking by issuing the personal challenge to join. This active pursuit, combined with prayerful dependence on God, builds Core Groups that are ready to launch.
