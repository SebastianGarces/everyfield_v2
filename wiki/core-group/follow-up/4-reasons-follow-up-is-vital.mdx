Follow-up after Vision Meetings serves four distinct purposes. Understanding each one helps you approach follow-up conversations with clarity and intentionality, ensuring you accomplish everything needed to move people toward commitment.

## Reason 1: Answer Questions

### Why It Matters

Many people have legitimate questions that didn't come up during Q&A—either because they were too shy to ask publicly, the question arose after they left, or they needed time to process before knowing what to ask.

An unanswered question often becomes a reason not to commit. People don't join things they don't understand or have concerns about.

<Callout type="insight">
  The questions people ask in follow-up conversations are often more honest and probing than what they'd ask in a group setting. This is where real concerns surface.
</Callout>

### How to Execute

**Create space for questions:**
- "What questions came up after you left?"
- "Is there anything about what we're doing that you'd like me to clarify?"
- "What concerns do you have that we should talk through?"

**Answer thoroughly but concisely:**
- Address the actual question, not what you think they should have asked
- Be honest when you don't know—"I don't know, but I'll find out"
- Don't be defensive about hard questions

**Follow up on answers:**
- If you promised to find information, deliver it promptly
- Check back: "Did that answer address your concern?"

### Common Questions to Expect

| Topic | Typical Questions |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Doctrine** | What do you believe about [specific issue]? |
| **Time commitment** | How much time does Core Group require? |
| **Financial** | What are the giving expectations? |
| **Family** | What about my spouse/kids? |
| **Their role** | What would I actually be doing? |
| **Timeline** | When is launch? How long is the process? |

## Reason 2: Re-Cast the Vision

### Why It Matters

Vision leaks. The excitement someone felt during the Vision Meeting fades as life's demands crowd in. A follow-up conversation gives you the opportunity to re-cast the vision—to remind them why this matters and what God is doing.

Many people need to hear the vision multiple times before it truly captures their heart. Great leaders understand this and continually cast vision of future days, events, and fruitfulness.

### How to Execute

**Connect to their story:**
- "What about what you heard resonated with you?"
- "Why did you come to the Vision Meeting in the first place?"
- "What would it mean for you to be part of something like this?"

**Paint the picture:**
- Share what the future could look like
- Tell stories of lives changed, communities impacted
- Help them see themselves in that future

**Create urgency:**
- "This is happening now. The train is leaving the station."
- "People are committing and joining. The team is forming."
- "We need people like you to make this work."

### Vision Re-Casting Tips

<Callout type="tip">
  Vision casting in a one-on-one setting can be even more powerful than in a group. You can personalize the vision to connect with their specific passions, gifts, and life situation.
</Callout>

- Listen first—understand what matters to them before casting vision
- Use "we" language—they're already being included
- Be specific—vague vision doesn't compel; specific vision does
- Show your own passion—enthusiasm is contagious

## Reason 3: Interview for Fit

### Why It Matters

Not everyone who attends a Vision Meeting and expresses interest is a good fit for the Core Group. Best practices include careful interviewing before allowing someone to sign up.

This protects everyone:
- It protects the person from committing to something that isn't right for them
- It protects the Core Group from members who will disrupt or disengage
- It protects you from spending energy on the wrong relationships

<Callout type="warning">
  A handful of wrong people can do more damage to your Core Group than a smaller group of right people. Don't skip the interview process in your eagerness to add numbers.
</Callout>

### The 5 Interview Considerations

#### 1. Maturity

Are they spiritually and emotionally mature?

**Look for:**
- Evidence of spiritual growth over time
- Ability to handle disagreement gracefully
- Self-awareness about their own weaknesses
- Emotional stability, not volatility

**Red flags:**
- Unresolved significant life issues
- Pattern of conflict or drama
- Spiritual immaturity masked by religious language

#### 2. Gifted

Do they bring a needed skill set?

**Look for:**
- Skills that serve the church's needs
- Willingness to use their gifts
- Track record of serving effectively

**Note:** This doesn't mean you only accept highly skilled people. It means you understand what they bring and where they might contribute.

#### 3. Chemistry

Is there good chemistry between you and them?

**Look for:**
- Natural ease in conversation
- Sense that you could work together
- Alignment in communication styles

**Reality check:** You don't have to be best friends, but there should be basic relational fit. If there's immediate friction, that's worth noting.

#### 4. Right Reasons

Are they coming for the right reasons?

**Good reasons:**
- Sense of calling to be part of building something new
- Alignment with vision and values
- Desire to grow and serve

**Concerning reasons:**
- Escaping problems at their current church
- Looking for position or influence
- Lonely and looking for any community
- Spouse is interested but they're not

#### 5. Season of Life

Are they in a stable season of life?

**Look for:**
- Relative stability in major life areas
- Capacity to take on a significant commitment
- No major transitions on the immediate horizon

**Concerning seasons:**
- In the middle of a major life crisis
- About to move, change jobs, or go through major transition
- Overcommitted with no margin

### How to Interview

- Keep it conversational, not interrogational
- Ask open-ended questions that reveal character
- Listen more than you talk
- Trust your instincts—if something feels off, explore it
- Be willing to say "not right now" gracefully

## Reason 4: Challenge to Commitment

### Why It Matters

Many people are waiting to be asked. They're interested, they're considering it, but they need someone to look them in the eye and directly challenge them to commit.

Without a clear challenge, people stay on the fence indefinitely. The follow-up conversation is where you make the ask.

<Callout type="important">
  Personally challenging acceptable candidates to join the Core Group is vital and must be consistently pursued. Don't skip this step—it's often the difference between interest and commitment.
</Callout>

### How to Execute

**Gauge readiness:**
- "Where are you in your thinking about joining the Core Group?"
- "What would help you make a decision?"
- "Is there anything holding you back?"

**Make the ask:**
- "I'd like to invite you to join the Core Group. Will you commit?"
- "We need people like you. I'm asking you to be part of this."
- "I believe you'd be a great fit. Are you ready to say yes?"

**Be direct but not manipulative:**
- State clearly what you're asking
- Don't pressure, guilt, or manipulate
- Give them permission to say no gracefully
- If they need time, set a timeline for decision

### Handling Different Responses

**"Yes!"**
- Celebrate with them
- Walk through next steps immediately
- Get their commitment in writing (commitment card)

**"Not yet, but I'm interested"**
- Clarify what they need to decide
- Set a timeline for follow-up
- Continue building relationship

**"No, this isn't for me"**
- Thank them graciously
- Leave the door open
- Ask if they know others who might be interested

**"I'm not sure"**
- Explore what's creating uncertainty
- Offer to answer more questions
- Give them a reasonable timeframe

## Putting It All Together

Every follow-up conversation should touch all four purposes, though the emphasis will vary based on the individual:

| If they are... | Emphasize... |
|----------------|--------------|
| Confused about details | Answering questions |
| Excited but fading | Re-casting vision |
| Enthusiastic but unknown | Interviewing for fit |
| Ready but uncommitted | Challenging to commit |

The goal is moving people from Vision Meeting attendee to committed Core Group member—and follow-up is how that happens.

Follow-up is pressing on—persistent, purposeful pursuit of the people God is drawing. Don't give up too easily. Keep pressing toward the goal.
