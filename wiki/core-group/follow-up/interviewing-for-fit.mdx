Not everyone who attends a Vision Meeting and expresses interest is a good fit for the Core Group. This isn't a judgment on their faith or value—it's a recognition that church planting requires a specific kind of commitment, and not everyone is in the right place to give it.

Best practices include careful interviewing before allowing someone to sign up. This guide walks you through the interview process using the five criteria that help you assess fit.

## Why Interviewing Matters

The Core Group is the foundation upon which your church will be built. These aren't casual attenders—they're co-laborers who will pray, give, invite, serve, and sacrifice alongside you. The quality of your Core Group determines the quality of your launch.

<Callout type="important">
  Building a smaller Core Group of the right people is far better than building a larger group with the wrong mix. One uncommitted or divisive member can undermine the entire team.
</Callout>

### What Interviewing Accomplishes

Interviewing serves multiple purposes:

- **Protects the Core Group** — Ensures unity and shared commitment
- **Protects the individual** — Prevents someone from committing to something they're not ready for
- **Sets expectations** — Creates clarity about what Core Group membership requires
- **Builds relationship** — Deepens your connection with potential members
- **Provides information** — Helps you understand their gifts, passions, and availability

## The Five Interview Criteria

The Launch Playbook identifies five key factors to evaluate when assessing fit. Each addresses a different dimension of readiness.

### 1. Maturity

**The Question:** Are they spiritually and emotionally mature?

Maturity isn't about age or years as a Christian. It's about spiritual depth and emotional health that enables someone to handle the challenges of church planting.

**What to Look For:**

| Mature | Immature |
|--------|----------|
| Takes ownership of their growth | Blames others for problems |
| Handles conflict biblically | Avoids or escalates conflict |
| Demonstrates self-awareness | Blind to personal weaknesses |
| Seeks counsel and feedback | Defensive when questioned |
| Stable through difficulties | Easily shaken by setbacks |

**Questions to Ask:**

- "Tell me about a difficult situation you've faced in a church. How did you handle it?"
- "What are you currently doing to grow spiritually?"
- "How do you typically respond when someone disagrees with you?"

<Callout type="tip">
  Pay attention to how they talk about previous churches or leaders. Consistent criticism of past experiences is a warning sign.
</Callout>

### 2. Gifted

**The Question:** Do they bring a needed skill set?

Core Group members don't all need the same gifts, but collectively, the group needs a range of abilities. Consider what skills the team currently has and what gaps exist.

**What to Look For:**

- Identifiable spiritual gifts (teaching, hospitality, administration, mercy, etc.)
- Professional skills useful to the plant (finance, marketing, technology, etc.)
- Relational connections that expand your reach
- Experience in areas you'll need (children's ministry, worship, small groups)

**Questions to Ask:**

- "Where have you served in church before? What did you enjoy most?"
- "What do others say you're good at?"
- "If you could do anything in the new church, what would excite you most?"

**A Note on Gifting:**

Don't add people solely because they have a needed skill. Gifting is important, but it doesn't override the other criteria. A skilled musician who lacks maturity or commitment will cause more problems than they solve.

### 3. Chemistry

**The Question:** Is there good chemistry between you and them?

Chemistry is harder to define but essential to assess. It's the intangible sense of fit—whether you can work well together, communicate easily, and build trust.

**What to Look For:**

- Natural rapport in conversation
- Shared values and priorities
- Similar ministry philosophy
- Ability to give and receive honest feedback
- Mutual respect and appreciation

**Questions to Ask:**

Chemistry is best assessed through conversation and observation rather than direct questions. Notice:

- Do you look forward to spending time with them?
- Can you imagine working closely with them for months or years?
- Do they seem to resonate with your leadership style?
- Is there mutual energy, or does the interaction feel forced?

<Callout type="insight">
  Chemistry doesn't mean you're identical. Healthy teams have diverse personalities. But there should be a baseline of mutual respect and ability to work together.
</Callout>

### 4. Right Reasons

**The Question:** Are they coming for the right reasons?

People are drawn to church plants for many reasons. Some are healthy motivations; others are warning signs.

**Healthy Motivations:**

- Genuine sense of calling to church planting
- Desire to reach unchurched people in your community
- Excitement about the vision and mission
- Willingness to build something from scratch
- Recognition that this is hard and they want to be part of it anyway

**Warning Signs:**

| Concerning Motivation | Why It's Problematic |
|----------------------|---------------------|
| Escaping a difficult church situation | Problems follow them; they may bring conflict |
| Seeking leadership position | May be disappointed when expectations aren't met |
| Looking for a church that fits their preferences | May leave when preferences aren't prioritized |
| Family member or friend pressure | Commitment won't last when things get hard |
| Theological axe to grind | May cause division over secondary issues |

**Questions to Ask:**

- "Why are you interested in being part of a church plant rather than joining an established church?"
- "What was your experience at your previous church?"
- "What are you hoping to find or experience with us?"

<Callout type="warning">
  Be especially cautious with people who have a trail of broken church relationships. Ask directly about their church history and listen carefully to how they describe past experiences.
</Callout>

### 5. Season of Life

**The Question:** Are they in a stable season of life?

Church planting demands significant time, energy, and emotional bandwidth. Someone in crisis or major transition may simply not have the capacity to give what Core Group membership requires.

**What to Look For:**

- Relative stability in major life areas (marriage, family, job, health)
- Margin in their schedule for the time commitment
- Emotional and relational health
- Support system in place (especially for single individuals)

**Seasons to Be Cautious About:**

- Major career transition or job loss
- Newlywed (first year of marriage)
- New baby or young children with limited childcare
- Health crisis (personal or immediate family)
- Recent loss or grief
- Unresolved marriage issues

**Questions to Ask:**

- "What does a typical week look like for you right now?"
- "What major changes or challenges are you navigating?"
- "Does your family fully support your involvement in this?"

**Timing Isn't Everything:**

Someone may be a great potential Core Group member—just not right now. If their season doesn't allow full participation, keep the relationship warm. Invite them to Vision Meetings. Stay connected. When their season changes, they may be ready.

## Conducting the Interview

### Setting the Tone

An interview shouldn't feel like an interrogation. It's a conversation—getting to know someone, understanding their story, and discerning fit together.

**Helpful framing:**

> "We want to get to know you better and make sure this is a good fit for both of us. We take Core Group membership seriously because we're building something together that requires real commitment. Is it okay if I ask you some questions?"

### Structure of the Conversation

1. **Connect personally** — Build rapport, show genuine interest in their life
2. **Hear their story** — How did they come to faith? What's their church background?
3. **Explore the five criteria** — Ask questions that help you assess each area
4. **Share expectations** — Be clear about what Core Group membership requires
5. **Answer their questions** — Create space for them to ask anything
6. **Determine next steps** — Either invite them, ask for more time, or graciously redirect

### Making the Decision

After the interview, prayerfully consider what you learned. If you're uncertain, it's okay to:

- Have another conversation
- Invite them to a Core Group meeting to observe
- Ask other Core Group members to spend time with them
- Wait and continue to build relationship

If you determine someone isn't a good fit:

- Be honest but gracious
- Thank them for their interest
- Explain that you don't think the timing or fit is right
- Leave the door open for the future if appropriate
- Help them find another church if needed

<Callout type="tip">
  When in doubt, don't add. It's easier to add someone later than to navigate the challenges of removing someone who isn't working out.
</Callout>

Building the right team is one of the most important decisions you'll make as a church planter. Take the time to interview well. The Core Group you build will determine the church you launch.
