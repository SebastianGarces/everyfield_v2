Not everyone who expresses interest in joining the Core Group should join. The interview process helps you assess fit—ensuring the right people end up in the right place. This protects the individual, protects the Core Group, and sets everyone up for success.

This guide walks you through how to conduct effective interviews that reveal character, capacity, and alignment.

## Why Interview?

The temptation is to accept everyone who shows interest. After all, you need to grow the group. But accepting the wrong people creates bigger problems than a smaller group would.

### What Can Go Wrong Without Interviews

- People join with wrong expectations, then become disappointed or disruptive
- Existing members are affected by someone who doesn't fit the culture
- Time and energy gets diverted to managing problems instead of building the church
- Unity is damaged by unresolved issues or misalignment
- The person has a bad experience that could have been prevented

<Callout type="insight">
  An interview isn't an interrogation or a test to pass. It's a mutual discernment process—both of you determining whether this is the right fit at the right time.

## The 5 Interview Criteria

Use these five criteria to guide your assessment:

### 1. Maturity

**What you're assessing:** Are they spiritually and emotionally mature enough for this commitment?

**Questions to explore:**

- "Tell me about your spiritual journey. How did you come to faith?"
- "How have you grown spiritually in the past few years?"
- "How do you typically handle conflict or disagreement?"
- "What's the biggest challenge you're facing right now?"

**What mature looks like:**
- Evidence of growth over time, not just current enthusiasm
- Self-awareness about strengths and weaknesses
- Ability to receive feedback without defensiveness
- Emotional stability, not reactivity

**Red flags:**
- Significant unresolved issues (addiction, marriage crisis, bitterness)
- Pattern of church-hopping or relational conflict
- Spiritual immaturity masked by religious vocabulary
- Unwillingness to look honestly at their own faults

### 2. Gifted

**What you're assessing:** What skills, abilities, and gifts do they bring?

**Questions to explore:**

- "What are you good at? Where do you naturally contribute?"
- "How have you served in churches or ministries before?"
- "What energizes you when you're serving?"
- "What would you love to do if you joined the Core Group?"

**What to look for:**
- Skills that align with church needs (leadership, music, children's ministry, administration, etc.)
- Track record of faithful service
- Willingness to serve in needed areas, not just preferred areas
- Teachable spirit that allows for growth

**Important note:** Being gifted doesn't mean being highly skilled. Someone with a servant heart and willingness to learn is more valuable than someone with impressive skills but a difficult attitude.

### 3. Chemistry

**What you're assessing:** Is there good relational fit between you, them, and the existing group?

**Questions to explore:**

- Observe: Is conversation natural or forced?
- "What did you think of the Vision Meeting?"
- "Who do you already know in the Core Group?"
- "What kind of community are you looking for?"

**What good chemistry looks like:**
- Ease in conversation
- Genuine warmth and connection
- Excitement that feels authentic, not performed
- Sense that you could work alongside this person

**What poor chemistry looks like:**
- Constant friction or misunderstanding
- Sense that they're performing rather than being real
- Gut feeling that something is off

<Callout type="tip">
  Trust your instincts about chemistry. If something feels off, don't dismiss that. Explore what's causing the concern before moving forward.
</Callout>

### 4. Right Reasons

**What you're assessing:** Why do they want to join? What's motivating them?

**Questions to explore:**

- "Why are you interested in being part of a church plant?"
- "What attracted you to this specific church?"
- "What are you hoping to find or experience?"
- "Tell me about your current church situation."

**Good reasons:**
- Sense of calling to be part of building something new
- Genuine alignment with vision and values
- Desire to grow spiritually and serve others
- Excitement about the specific mission and distinctives

**Concerning reasons:**

| Concerning Reason | Why It's Concerning |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Escaping problems at current church | Unresolved issues will follow them |
| Looking for position or influence | Self-centered motivation |
| Lonely and looking for any community | Will they stay when it gets hard? |
| Spouse wants it but they're lukewarm | Divided households create problems |
| Attracted by what they'll receive, not give | Consumer mentality |

### 5. Season of Life

**What you're assessing:** Are they in a season where they can make and sustain this commitment?

**Questions to explore:**

- "What does life look like for you right now?"
- "What other commitments are competing for your time?"
- "Are any major changes on your horizon?"
- "How does your spouse/family feel about this?"

**Good seasons:**
- Relative stability in work, family, and life circumstances
- Margin available to take on a significant commitment
- Support from spouse/family
- No major transitions imminent

**Challenging seasons:**
- In the middle of a major life crisis
- About to move, change jobs, or face major transition
- Overwhelmed with other commitments
- Spouse unsupportive or opposed

<Callout type="warning">
  Someone in a difficult season isn't a bad person—they're just in a bad season. It may be loving to say "not now" and leave the door open for when circumstances change.
</Callout>

## How to Conduct the Interview

### Setting

- One-on-one is usually best (coffee, meal, living room)
- Choose a setting that allows for honest conversation
- Allow plenty of time—don't rush

### Approach

**Make it conversational:**
- This isn't a job interview or interrogation
- Ask questions naturally as part of getting to know them
- Share about yourself as well

**Listen more than you talk:**
- Ask open-ended questions
- Follow up on interesting or concerning answers
- Pay attention to what they don't say

**Be honest about the process:**
- "I want to make sure this is the right fit for you and for us"
- "I'm going to ask some questions to help us both discern"
- "Feel free to ask me anything too"

### Questions to Ask

**Icebreakers:**
- "Tell me your story. How did you end up here?"
- "What's been your church experience like?"

**Exploring depth:**
- "How would you describe your relationship with Jesus right now?"
- "What's God teaching you these days?"
- "What's been a significant challenge you've navigated?"

**Exploring commitment:**
- "What does commitment look like for you?"
- "How do you handle it when things get hard?"
- "What concerns do you have about joining?"

**Exploring expectations:**
- "What do you hope to find in the Core Group?"
- "What would success look like for you in this?"
- "What questions do you have for me?"

## After the Interview

### If It's a Clear Yes

- Express excitement about having them join
- Walk through the commitment process
- Provide the commitment card and explain expectations
- Set a time for them to return the signed card

### If It's a Clear No

Be gracious but honest:

- "I appreciate you meeting with me. Based on our conversation, I don't think this is the right fit right now."
- Give specific, kind feedback if appropriate
- Leave the door open: "If circumstances change, I'd love to revisit this."
- Suggest alternatives if appropriate

### If It's Uncertain

Sometimes you need more information or time:

- "I enjoyed our conversation. I'd like to meet again before we move forward."
- "Can I think about our conversation and get back to you?"
- Consult with trusted advisors if helpful
- Don't rush a decision you're not sure about

---

## When to Say No

It's hard to turn people away, but sometimes it's the right call:

### Clear No Situations

- Significant unresolved sin or crisis that needs attention first
- Hostility toward authority or consistent pattern of conflict
- Clearly misaligned with doctrine or values
- Looking for something you can't provide

### Gentle Redirect Situations

- Good person, wrong season—encourage them to stay connected
- Needs growth before commitment—invite to Vision Meetings while they mature
- Better fit elsewhere—direct them to another church or opportunity

<Callout type="insight">
  Saying no is often the most loving thing you can do. You're protecting them from committing to something that won't serve them well, and you're protecting the Core Group from potential disruption.
</Callout>
