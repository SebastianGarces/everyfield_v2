Peak Performance is a three-session training series that serves as your church's membership class. Every Launch Team member should complete this series before Launch Sunday—and it becomes the pathway for new members after launch.

The series accomplishes two critical goals: it ensures alignment around your church's DNA, and it creates a clear pathway for commitment.

## Why Peak Performance?

New churches often assume alignment exists because enthusiasm is high. But enthusiasm without understanding leads to confusion and conflict later. Peak Performance creates **informed commitment**.

<Callout type="insight">
  People can't commit to what they don't understand. Peak Performance gives 
  them the clarity needed to commit wholeheartedly—or to recognize they're 
  not the right fit.
</Callout>

### What Peak Performance Accomplishes

| Session | Outcome |
|---------|---------|
| **Peak Performance I** | Understanding of vision and values |
| **Peak Performance II** | Alignment on beliefs and doctrine |
| **Peak Performance III** | Clarity on commitment and next steps |

</Callout>

  ask questions. Pressured commitment creates shallow members.
</Callout>

## Logistics and Format

### Session Length

Plan for 90 minutes per session:
- 60 minutes of content
- 15 minutes for Q&A
- 15 minutes for fellowship and follow-up

### Scheduling Options

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **Three consecutive weeks** | Momentum, easy to track | Requires three-week commitment |
| **One intensive day** | Complete in one sitting | Long day, less reflection time |
| **Monthly rotation** | Flexible entry points | Takes longer to complete |

For the Launch Team, three consecutive weeks works best. After launch, consider a monthly rotation for ongoing membership.

### Materials Needed

- [ ] PowerPoint or slides for each session
- [ ] Handouts summarizing key content
- [ ] Statement of faith document
- [ ] Commitment cards
- [ ] Ministry team descriptions and sign-up sheets
- [ ] Small group information
- [ ] Name tags and sign-in sheets

## Running Peak Performance for Your Launch Team

For your Launch Team, Peak Performance serves as both training and commitment formalization. Schedule the series early enough in Phase 3 that everyone completes it well before launch.

### Recommendations

1. **Require attendance** — Make clear this is expected of all Launch Team members
2. **Provide make-up options** — Offer alternative times for those who miss sessions
3. **Use it as alignment check** — Pay attention to questions and concerns raised
4. **Celebrate completion** — Recognize those who complete the series

<Callout type="warning">
  If someone in your Launch Team resists completing Peak Performance, that's 
  a signal worth exploring. Commitment to the process reflects commitment to 
  the mission.
</Callout>

---

## After Launch

Peak Performance becomes your ongoing membership pathway. New guests who want to join complete the series and sign commitment cards just like your Launch Team did.

### Ongoing Schedule

Most churches offer Peak Performance:
- Monthly (one session per month, rotating)
- Quarterly (three-week intensive each quarter)
- On demand (when enough new people are ready)

Choose the rhythm that fits your context and growth pace.
