description: The three primary objectives that should drive every Launch Team meeting during the training phase.

*/}

When your Core Group transitions to a Launch Team, your meetings change. They become more frequent, more focused, and more intentional. Every gathering should accomplish three primary objectives: **Inspire**, **Instill**, and **Inform**.

Miss any of these, and your team arrives at Launch Sunday either unmotivated, misaligned, or unprepared.

---

## The Three Objectives

| Objective | Purpose | Method |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| **Inspire** | Keep the vision alive | Worship, devotional, prayer, updates |
| **Instill** | Enculturate the team | Teaching on values, distinctives, DNA |
| **Inform** | Train for responsibilities | Corporate training, ministry team training |

<Callout type="insight">
  These three objectives map to head, heart, and hands. Inspire touches the 
  heart. Instill shapes the mind. Inform equips the hands.
</Callout>

## Objective 1: Inspire (Cast Vision)

**Purpose:** Keep people connected to why they're doing this.

The long months of preparation can drain enthusiasm. Weekly meetings, training sessions, and logistical details can make people forget the bigger picture. Your job as a leader is to continually fan the flame of vision.

### How to Inspire

| Element | What It Accomplishes |
|---------|---------------------|
| **Worship** | Renews focus on God and His greatness |
| **Devotional** | Grounds the team in Scripture |
| **Prayer** | Cultivates dependence on God |
| **Updates** | Shows what God is doing locally and beyond |

### Practical Application

- Open every meeting with worship—even if it's just a few songs
- Share a brief devotional that connects to the mission
- Pray specifically for the launch, for the community, for each other
- Celebrate wins: new people joining, resources provided, prayers answered

<Callout type="tip">
  Share stories from other church plants. Hearing how God is moving elsewhere 
  reminds your team that they're part of something bigger.
</Callout>

### Warning Signs

If your team shows signs of discouragement, cynicism, or going-through-the-motions, you may be under-investing in inspiration. Double down on vision casting before fatigue sets in.

---

## Objective 2: Instill (Enculturate Team)

**Purpose:** Build deep alignment around values, distinctives, and DNA.

A team that shares the same values works together smoothly. A team with conflicting assumptions creates friction. Instillation is the process of thoroughly enculturating your Launch Team in what makes your church distinct.

### What to Instill

| Topic | Why It Matters |
|-------|---------------|
| **4 Pillars** | The theological foundation of your church |
| **Worship/Walk/Work** | The discipleship model that shapes ministry |
| **Ministry Funnel** | How people move from guests to servants |
| **Core Values** | The non-negotiables that guide decisions |
| **Distinctives** | What makes your church unique |

### How to Instill

- **Teaching** — Dedicated time in meetings for values-based teaching
- **Visiting** — Take the team to visit established partner churches
- **Training Events** — Attend regional or network training together
- **Discussion** — Create space for questions and dialogue

### Practical Application

- Dedicate 15-20 minutes of each meeting to teaching on DNA
- Assign reading from foundational documents
- Schedule at least one observation visit to a partner church
- Use case studies: "How would our values apply in this situation?"

<Callout type="important">
  Don't assume people absorbed everything from Vision Meetings. Instillation 
  requires repetition. Teach the same truths from different angles until 
  they're second nature.
</Callout>

---

## Objective 3: Inform (Train the Team)

**Purpose:** Equip people with the knowledge and skills they need.

This is where the practical work happens. Training turns willing people into capable servants.

### Training Layers

| Layer | Description | Examples |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Corporate Training** | Whole-team learning | Peak Performance Series, Boot Camp |
| **Ministry Team Training** | Role-specific learning | Children's Ministry protocols, Worship team rehearsals |
| **Outside Training** | Learning from others | Network conferences, ministry workshops |
| **Hands-on Observation** | Learning by watching | Visiting partner churches, shadowing leaders |

### How to Inform

- Schedule dedicated training blocks within meetings
- Break into ministry teams for specialized training
- Bring in experienced leaders to teach specific topics
- Create opportunities for practice (Pre-Launch Services)

### Practical Application

- Complete Peak Performance Series with the whole team
- Give ministry team leaders time to train their teams
- Schedule observation visits where teams shadow their counterparts at established churches
- Use Pre-Launch Services as full dress rehearsals

## Meeting Structure Example

Here's how a typical Launch Team meeting might incorporate all three objectives:

| Time | Activity | Objective |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 6:30 - 6:45 | Arrival and fellowship | — |
| 6:45 - 7:00 | Worship (2-3 songs) | Inspire |
| 7:00 - 7:15 | Devotional and prayer | Inspire |
| 7:15 - 7:30 | Updates and celebration | Inspire |
| 7:30 - 8:00 | Teaching: Core values/distinctives | Instill |
| 8:00 - 8:45 | Training: Ministry team breakouts | Inform |
| 8:45 - 9:00 | Closing announcements and prayer | — |

Adjust the balance based on where you are in the timeline. Early in Phase 3, lean heavier on Instill and Inform. As launch approaches, increase the Inspire component to build momentum.

## Meeting Frequency

As you progress through Phase 3, meeting frequency should increase:

| Phase | Frequency | Focus |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| **Early Phase 3** | Bi-weekly | Foundation building |
| **Mid Phase 3** | Weekly | Training intensification |
| **Final Month** | Weekly + ministry meetings | Integration and practice |

<Callout type="warning">
  Don't peak too early. Maintain a sustainable pace early on, then intensify 
  as Launch Sunday approaches. Burning out your team before launch defeats 
  the purpose.
</Callout>

---

## Balancing the Three

All three objectives matter, but the balance shifts over time:

| Timing | Primary Focus |
|--------|---------------|
| **Months out** | Instill (build alignment) |
| **Weeks out** | Inform (complete training) |
| **Days out** | Inspire (build momentum) |

Never drop any objective entirely. Even on your most training-heavy night, start with worship and prayer. Even on your most inspirational night, include practical updates.

Your meetings are more than logistics. They're the furnace where your team is forged. Inspire them, instill truth in them, and inform them—and they'll be ready for whatever Launch Sunday brings.
