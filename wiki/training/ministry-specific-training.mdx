Corporate training builds shared understanding. Ministry-specific training builds specialized competence. Each ministry team needs customized training that prepares them for their unique responsibilities.

This article outlines the training requirements for each key ministry area.

---

## The Training Principle

Every ministry team needs training in three areas:

| Area | Question Answered |
|------|------------------|
| **Philosophy** | Why do we do this ministry? |
| **Procedures** | How do we execute our responsibilities? |
| **Practice** | Have we rehearsed until we're confident? |

Skip any of these, and teams arrive at Launch Sunday either unmotivated (missing philosophy), confused (missing procedures), or unprepared (missing practice).

<Callout type="important">
  Ministry-specific training should be 90-100% complete by the time you 
  reach the final 3-4 weeks before launch. That final window is for 
  integration, not foundational training.
</Callout>
