Training without clear goals is aimless activity. Before you begin Phase 3, you need to know exactly what "ready" looks like. This article outlines the specific goals your Launch Team must achieve by Launch Sunday.

These aren't aspirational targets—they're minimum requirements for a healthy launch.

## The Five Readiness Areas

By Launch Sunday, your church must be ready in five critical areas:

| Area | What It Means |
|------|---------------|
| **High Impact Service** | Every element of Sunday morning is prepared and rehearsed |
| **Assimilation** | Processes are in place to connect guests to the church |
| **Small Groups** | Groups are ready to launch shortly after Launch Sunday |
| **Active Service** | Ministry teams are trained and positioned |
| **Leadership Development** | Pipeline for developing future leaders is established |

<Callout type="important">
  A weak launch in any of these five areas creates problems that compound 
  over time. Take the time to achieve readiness across all five.
</Callout>

## High Impact Service

Your first Sunday service sets the tone for everything that follows. Guests form lasting impressions within minutes. The goal is a service that honors God and serves people excellently.

### Requirements

| Role | Readiness Standard |
|------|-------------------|
| **Senior Pastor** | Prepared to preach with clarity and passion |
| **Worship Leader** | Worship team rehearsed and ready to lead |
| **Children's Ministry** | Age-appropriate environments fully set up |
| **Facilities** | Venue transformed into a welcoming worship space |
| **Administration** | Systems in place for offering, communication, and records |

### Key Questions

- Is your preaching calendar established for the first sermon series?
- Has the worship team rehearsed together multiple times?
- Is every children's room equipped with curriculum, supplies, and trained volunteers?
- Have you conducted full run-throughs of the service flow?

---

## Assimilation

Getting guests through the door is only half the battle. The other half is connecting them to the life of the church. Your assimilation process should be designed and ready before Launch Sunday.

### Requirements

- Guest registration process established (Friendship Registers, connection cards)
- Database software selected and configured
- Follow-up process documented (who contacts, when, how)
- Guest reception area planned
- Party with the Pastor scheduled for shortly after launch

### Key Questions

- Do you have a clear path for moving someone from first-time guest to connected member?
- Is your database ready to capture and track guest information?
- Do you have trained people assigned to guest follow-up?
- Is your follow-up timeline defined (24-hour call, 48-hour letter, etc.)?

<Callout type="tip">
  Test your assimilation process during Pre-Launch Services. Have Launch Team 
  members role-play as guests to identify gaps in the system.
</Callout>

## Small Groups

Small groups are where discipleship happens. While groups may not launch on the same day as Sunday services, they should be **fully ready** to launch within weeks of Launch Sunday.

### Requirements

| Element | Readiness Standard |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Philosophy** | Small group model clearly defined and communicated |
| **Leaders** | Group leaders identified, trained, and assigned |
| **Curriculum** | First study selected and materials obtained |
| **Roll-out Plan** | Launch date and sign-up process determined |
| **Coaching Structure** | Small group coaches identified (if applicable) |

### Key Questions

- Do you have enough trained leaders to launch the number of groups you need?
- Have leaders completed Small Group 101 training?
- Is the sign-up and assignment process defined?
- Do you have an apprentice development plan for future leaders?

---

## Active Service

Launch Sunday requires people serving in every ministry area. These teams must be recruited, trained, and positioned before the big day.

### Ministry Teams to Establish

| Team | Primary Responsibilities |
|------|-------------------------|
| **Facilities** | Set-up, tear-down, parking, signage |
| **Children's Ministry** | Teaching, check-in, safety, room management |
| **Assimilation** | Greeting, ushering, guest follow-up |
| **Small Groups** | Leading and shepherding group members |
| **Worship & Production** | Music, audio, video, lighting |
| **Promotion** | Marketing, communication, social media |
| **Prayer** | Intercessory prayer before and during services |
| **Technology** | Website, presentation software, equipment |
| **Administration** | Finance, records, communication |

### Key Questions

- Does every team have a designated leader?
- Has each team received ministry-specific training?
- Do teams have written checklists for their responsibilities?
- Have teams practiced their roles during Pre-Launch Services?

---

## Leadership Development

A healthy church develops leaders continuously. By Launch Sunday, you should have systems in place to identify and develop future leaders.

### Requirements

- **Boot Camp** — Intensive discipleship program ready to launch
- **Potential Leaders** — Emerging leaders identified and targeted for development
- **Apprentice Model** — Plan for developing leaders within each ministry team
- **Leadership Pipeline** — Clear pathway from new believer to ministry leader

### Key Questions

- Have you identified the top 10-20 emerging leaders in your Launch Team?
- Is Boot Camp scheduled to begin shortly after launch?
- Does each ministry team leader have an apprentice in development?

<Callout type="insight">
  The leaders you develop in year one become the foundation for growth in 
  years two and three. Start the pipeline early.
</Callout>

  *"For which of you, desiring to build a tower, does not first sit down and 
  count the cost, whether he has enough to complete it?"* — Luke 14:28
</Callout>

Count the cost. Set clear goals. Then pursue them with excellence. Launch Sunday readiness doesn't happen by accident—it happens by intention.
