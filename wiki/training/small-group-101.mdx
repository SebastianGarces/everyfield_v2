Small groups are where discipleship happens. Sunday services gather the church, but small groups grow the church. Every healthy church plant needs trained small group leaders ready to shepherd people in community.

Small Group 101 is your training course for equipping those leaders.

---

## Why Small Groups Matter

Small groups accomplish what Sunday services cannot:

| Sunday Service | Small Group |
|----------------|-------------|
| Inspires many at once | Develops individuals deeply |
| One-way communication | Interactive discussion |
| Anonymous attendance possible | Accountability and relationship |
| Surface-level connection | Genuine community |

<Callout type="insight">
  Sunday services can draw a crowd, but small groups build a church. 
  Without healthy small groups, growth becomes a mile wide and an inch deep.
</Callout>

A church of 100 without small groups has 100 loosely connected individuals. A church of 100 with strong small groups has 10 families deeply invested in each other's lives.

## Session 1: Philosophy and Purpose

**Goal:** Leaders understand *why* small groups exist and how they fit into the church's discipleship model.

### Content to Cover

| Topic | Key Points |
|-------|------------|
| **Biblical Foundation** | Acts 2:42-47, one-anothers, early church model |
| **Discipleship Model** | Where groups fit in Worship/Walk/Work |
| **The Ministry Funnel** | How people move from guest to group |
| **Group Purpose** | Community, growth, care, mission |
| **Expectations** | What's expected of leaders and members |

### Key Concepts

**The "Walk" in Worship/Walk/Work**

Small groups are the "Walk" component—where believers walk together in community, growing in Christlikeness through relationship.

**The Three Purposes of Small Groups**

1. **Connect** — Build authentic relationships
2. **Grow** — Study Scripture and apply it together
3. **Serve** — Care for one another and reach outward

<Callout type="tip">
  Help leaders see that their group isn't just a Bible study—it's a 
  community with a mission. Groups that only study together eventually 
  stagnate. Groups that serve together thrive.
</Callout>

## Session 2: Facilitation Skills

**Goal:** Leaders can guide engaging, transformative group discussions.

### Content to Cover

| Topic | Key Points |
|-------|------------|
| **Facilitator vs. Teacher** | Drawing out vs. pouring in |
| **Question Types** | Open, closed, application, personal |
| **Discussion Dynamics** | Handling talkers, drawing out quiet members |
| **Creating Safety** | Confidentiality, vulnerability, grace |
| **Time Management** | Balancing fellowship, study, and prayer |

### The Art of Asking Questions

Good facilitators ask questions that open conversation, not shut it down.

| Instead of... | Ask... |
|---------------|--------|
| "The answer is grace, right?" | "What stands out to you in this passage?" |
| "Don't you agree that...?" | "How have you seen this play out in your life?" |
| "Does anyone have questions?" | "What questions does this raise for you?" |

### Handling Common Challenges

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| **The talker** | "Great insight. Let's hear from someone who hasn't shared yet." |
| **The silent member** | "Sarah, I'd love to hear your perspective on this." |
| **The tangent** | "That's interesting. Let's table that for after group." |
| **The debater** | "Good question. What do others think?" |
| **The advice-giver** | "Instead of solutions, let's just listen and pray." |

<Callout type="warning">
  New leaders often over-prepare content and under-prepare for group 
  dynamics. The best content means nothing if the discussion falls flat. 
  Spend as much time preparing to facilitate as preparing the material.
</Callout>

## Session 3: Shepherding Skills

**Goal:** Leaders can care for group members through life's challenges.

### Content to Cover

| Topic | Key Points |
|-------|------------|
| **Shepherd's Heart** | Caring for people, not just managing meetings |
| **One-on-One Connection** | Meeting with members outside of group |
| **Crisis Response** | How to respond when life falls apart |
| **Appropriate Referral** | Knowing when to involve pastors or professionals |
| **Prayer Ministry** | Praying for and with group members |

### The Shepherding Rhythm

Effective small group leaders maintain connection between meetings:

| Frequency | Activity |
|-----------|----------|
| **Weekly** | Check-in texts or calls |
| **Monthly** | One-on-one coffee or meal with a member |
| **As needed** | Crisis response and hospital visits |
| **Ongoing** | Prayer for each member by name |

### Knowing Your Limits

Small group leaders are not counselors, therapists, or pastors. Train leaders to recognize when situations require referral:

- Mental health crises
- Marriage counseling needs
- Addiction issues
- Abuse situations
- Complex theological questions

<Callout type="important">
  The goal is not to equip leaders to handle every situation—it's to equip 
  them to recognize what they can handle and what requires the Senior Pastor 
  or professional help.
</Callout>

## Session 4: Multiplication and Apprenticeship

**Goal:** Leaders understand how to develop future leaders and multiply their group.

### Content to Cover

| Topic | Key Points |
|-------|------------|
| **Why Multiply** | Kingdom growth, leadership development, fresh energy |
| **The Apprentice Model** | Identifying and developing potential leaders |
| **Multiplication Pathway** | How groups grow and birth new groups |
| **Overcoming Resistance** | Addressing fear of change |
| **Healthy Endings** | Celebrating and transitioning well |

### The Apprentice Pathway

1. **Identify** — Look for the "3 C's": Character, Competence, Chemistry
2. **Invite** — Ask them to consider leadership
3. **Include** — Bring them into planning and decision-making
4. **Instruct** — Teach them through explanation and observation
5. **Release** — Gradually hand over responsibilities
6. **Launch** — Send them to lead their own group

### When to Multiply

Groups should consider multiplication when:
- Size consistently exceeds 12-15 people
- An apprentice is ready to lead
- The group has been together 12-18 months
- Energy is high and momentum is strong

<Callout type="tip">
  Multiplication is easier when it's expected from the beginning. Tell new 
  groups on day one: "Our goal is to grow and multiply so more people can 
  experience this kind of community."
</Callout>

  not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging

Small groups are where "one another" happens. Train your leaders well, and you'll build a church where no one walks alone.
