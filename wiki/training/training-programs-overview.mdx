Once your Core Group transitions to a Launch Team with an established launch date, the mission shifts. Vision Meetings continue, but the primary focus becomes **training and preparation** for Launch Sunday.

This phase is where your team transforms from enthusiastic supporters into equipped servants ready to execute every aspect of a high-impact church launch.

## Why Training Matters

A church plant can have the right people, adequate funding, and a great location—but without proper training, Launch Sunday becomes chaotic instead of celebratory. Training accomplishes three essential outcomes:

1. **Competence** — Team members know what to do and how to do it well
2. **Confidence** — Trained teams serve with assurance rather than anxiety
3. **Cohesion** — Training builds teamwork and shared understanding

  Training doesn't just prepare individuals—it transforms a group of committed 
  people into a unified team that can execute together under pressure.

## The Training Framework

Phase 3 training operates on three levels, each serving a distinct purpose:

### Corporate Training

Training delivered to the entire Launch Team together. This builds shared understanding and team unity.

| Program | Purpose | Audience |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Peak Performance Series | Membership and discipleship foundations | All Launch Team members |
| Boot Camp | Intensive discipleship and leadership development | Emerging leaders |

### Ministry Team Training

Specialized training for each ministry area. This builds competence in specific responsibilities.

| Ministry | Training Focus |
|----------|----------------|
| Worship & Production | Service flow, equipment, transitions |
| Children's Ministry | Curriculum, check-in, safety protocols |
| Facilities | Set-up, tear-down, storage procedures |
| Assimilation | Guest process, database, follow-up |
| Small Groups | Leader training, group dynamics, curriculum |

### Observation & Practice

Learning by watching established churches and practicing in your own context.

- Visit partner churches to observe their operations
- Conduct Pre-Launch Services as full rehearsals
- Practice set-up and tear-down until it becomes second nature

## Training Timeline

Training should be **90-100% complete** by the time you reach the final 3-4 weeks before launch. That final window is for integration and refinement—not foundational training.

| Timeframe | Focus |
|-----------|-------|
| **Early Phase 3** | Corporate training (Peak Performance, Boot Camp) |
| **Mid Phase 3** | Ministry team training begins |
| **Late Phase 3** | Practice, observation visits, refinement |
| **Final 3-4 Weeks** | Pre-Launch Services, integration, final prep |

<Callout type="warning">
  Don't wait until the last minute to train. Rushed training produces anxious 
  teams. Give your people time to learn, practice, and gain confidence.
</Callout>

## The Three Meeting Objectives

As your Launch Team meetings become more frequent, they serve three primary objectives:

1. **Inspire** — Continue casting vision through worship, devotional, and prayer
2. **Instill** — Enculturate the team in values, distinctives, and DNA
3. **Inform** — Train the team in their specific responsibilities

## Training is Discipleship

Never forget that training is ultimately about discipleship. You're not just teaching skills—you're developing people who will serve the Lord and His church for years to come.

The goal isn't a perfect launch. The goal is mature believers equipped for works of service. Launch Sunday is simply the first opportunity to put that equipping into practice.

Your job is to equip. Their job is to serve. Together, you build the body of Christ.
