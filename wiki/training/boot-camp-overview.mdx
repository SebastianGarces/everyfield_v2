*/}

Peak Performance covers the foundations. Boot Camp goes deeper. This intensive discipleship program is designed for emerging leaders—those who will carry significant responsibility in the life of your church.

Boot Camp isn't for everyone. It's for those ready to be stretched, challenged, and developed into the leaders your church needs.

---

## What is Boot Camp?

Boot Camp is an intensive discipleship experience that goes beyond membership training to develop character, conviction, and competence in future leaders.

| Peak Performance | Boot Camp |
|-----------------|-----------|
| Membership foundations | Leadership development |
| All members | Emerging leaders |
| 3 sessions | Extended commitment |
| What we believe | How we live and lead |
| Information | Transformation |

<Callout type="insight">
  Peak Performance asks, "Do you understand our church?" Boot Camp asks, 
  "Are you ready to lead in our church?"
</Callout>

## Why Boot Camp Matters

Every healthy church needs a pipeline of developing leaders. Without intentional leadership development, you'll face a perpetual shortage of qualified people to serve in key roles.

### Boot Camp Accomplishes

1. **Deepened Discipleship** — Participants grow in spiritual maturity
2. **Identified Leaders** — You discover who's ready for greater responsibility
3. **Shared DNA** — Leaders are thoroughly enculturated in your values
4. **Relational Bonds** — Participants form lasting connections
5. **Equipped Servants** — Leaders gain practical ministry skills

---

## Who Should Attend?

Boot Camp is for **emerging leaders**—people who show potential for significant ministry responsibility. They may be:

- Future ministry team leaders
- Future small group leaders
- Future staff members
- Key volunteers ready for more

### Selection Criteria

Look for the **3 C's**:

| Criteria | What to Look For |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Character** | Integrity, humility, teachability, spiritual maturity |
| **Competence** | Skills, gifts, ability to learn and grow |
| **Chemistry** | Alignment with vision, ability to work well with others |

<Callout type="warning">
  Boot Camp isn't a reward for enthusiasm. Select participants based on 
  potential and readiness, not just willingness. Not everyone who wants to 
  lead is ready to lead.
</Callout>

## Boot Camp Curriculum

Boot Camp content should cover three domains: **Being**, **Knowing**, and **Doing**.

### Domain 1: Being (Character Development)

Who we are matters more than what we do. Boot Camp prioritizes character formation.

| Topic | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| **Spiritual Disciplines** | Prayer, Scripture, fasting, solitude |
| **Personal Holiness** | Purity, integrity, self-control |
| **Humility and Teachability** | Receiving correction, admitting weakness |
| **Emotional Health** | Self-awareness, healthy relationships |
| **Servant Leadership** | Leading by serving, not position |

### Domain 2: Knowing (Theological Foundations)

Leaders need deeper theological grounding than the average member.

| Topic | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| **Gospel Fluency** | Articulating the gospel clearly |
| **Biblical Theology** | How the Bible fits together |
| **Ecclesiology** | Theology of the local church |
| **Apologetics** | Defending the faith graciously |
| **Church History** | Learning from those who came before |

### Domain 3: Doing (Ministry Skills)

Theory without practice produces ineffective leaders.

| Topic | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| **Leadership Principles** | Vision, delegation, decision-making |
| **Teaching and Communication** | Clear, compelling delivery |
| **Pastoral Care** | Shepherding people through challenges |
| **Conflict Resolution** | Handling disagreements biblically |
| **Team Building** | Recruiting, training, releasing |

## Boot Camp Format Options

### Option 1: Weekly Cohort

| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Duration** | 12-16 weeks |
| **Frequency** | Weekly, 2 hours |
| **Size** | 8-12 participants |
| **Format** | Teaching + discussion + application |

**Pros:** Sustained development, time to process and apply
**Cons:** Long commitment, harder to maintain momentum

### Option 2: Intensive Retreat

| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Duration** | Weekend retreat |
| **Setting** | Off-site location |
| **Format** | Immersive teaching, worship, community |

**Pros:** Deep relational bonding, focused attention
**Cons:** Covers less material, less time for application

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach

Combine a retreat weekend with follow-up sessions:

1. **Kickoff Retreat** — Intensive weekend together
2. **Weekly Sessions** — 8-10 weeks of continued development
3. **Graduation** — Commissioning into leadership roles

<Callout type="tip">
  The hybrid approach often works best. The retreat builds community and 
  creates momentum; the weekly sessions provide space for deeper learning 
  and accountability.
</Callout>

## Leading Boot Camp

### Who Should Lead?

The Senior Pastor should be directly involved in Boot Camp leadership. This is where you pour into your future leaders—it can't be fully delegated.

Consider involving:
- Senior Pastor (primary leader)
- Experienced elders or leaders
- Guest speakers for specific topics

### Creating the Right Environment

Boot Camp should feel different from other church training:

| Element | Why It Matters |
|---------|---------------|
| **Smaller group** | Allows for deeper relationship |
| **Higher expectations** | Communicates this is serious |
| **Vulnerability** | Leaders model transparency |
| **Accountability** | Participants challenge each other |
| **Application** | Learning is tested in real ministry |

## Before Launch: Boot Camp Timing

For your Launch Team, consider offering a condensed Boot Camp during Phase 3 to develop your initial leadership core.

### Pre-Launch Boot Camp

| Approach | Timing |
|----------|--------|
| **Intensive** | Full weekend, 3-6 weeks before launch |
| **Condensed** | 4-6 weekly sessions during Phase 3 |
| **Combined** | Weekend retreat + 3-4 follow-up sessions |

### Who to Include Pre-Launch

Prioritize those who will hold key roles:
- Ministry team leaders
- Small group leaders
- Those with clear leadership gifting

<Callout type="important">
  You can't train everyone in Boot Camp before launch. Focus on your key 
  leaders first. Establish an ongoing Boot Camp rhythm after launch for 
  continued development.
</Callout>

---

## After Launch: Ongoing Boot Camp

Make Boot Camp a regular part of your leadership development pipeline:

| Frequency | Format |
|-----------|--------|
| **Annual** | Once per year, new cohort each time |
| **Bi-annual** | Spring and Fall cohorts |
| **Continuous** | Rolling enrollment, ongoing sessions |

### Boot Camp → Leadership Pipeline

Boot Camp should feed into leadership roles:

```
Boot Camp Graduate
      ↓
Ministry Team Leader / Small Group Leader
      ↓
Ministry Director / Small Group Coach
      ↓
Elder Candidate / Staff
```

  *"And what you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses entrust

Boot Camp is 2 Timothy 2:2 in action: entrusting truth to faithful people who will entrust it to others. Invest deeply in your emerging leaders, and they'll multiply your impact for generations.
